For example, other planar card-like or sheet-like objects, and groups of cards, or card-like objects may be supported by the brackets for display. The pockets formed by the brackets provide a product-bearing assembly capable of supporting any type of three-dimensional product, and is ideally suited for supporting and displaying products of generally rectilinear configuration such as printed media, generally including magazines, product brochures, newspapers, books, greeting cards, packaged multi-media and the like. Moreover, the pockets could be adapted to display a variety of non-printed materials, including non-printed media. It is appreciated that the apparatus is capable of use with an unlimited variety of articles, which broad use is intended to be comprehended herein.
