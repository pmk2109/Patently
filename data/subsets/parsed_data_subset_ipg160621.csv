The secondary alcohol may be used to prepare esters, especially phthalate esters or cyclohexanoate diesters, which are useful as plasticizers. These esters are more effective as plasticizers than esters derived from other secondary alcohols due to their high C2 point of attachment.","All patents and patent applications, test procedures (such as ASTM methods, UL methods, and the like), and other documents cited herein are fully incorporated by reference to the extent such disclosure is not inconsistent with this invention and for all jurisdictions in which such incorporation is permitted.","['1.

A corresponding system and computer program product also is provided.","The example illustrates that embodiments of the present invention using the concepts of information gain can be far more efficient or more advanced than known algorithms. The results also demonstrate that dynamic angle selection is not only useful in the domain of an extremely small number of projection angles (i.e. less than 10). In fact, as illustrated in the example for the more complex Phantom 4, which clearly has a certain preferential orientation, the dynamic angle selection scheme mainly outperforms the standard method if there are more than 10 projections. This means that the approach can also be useful for angle selection in the reconstruction of quite complex objects, such as trabecular bones, where it is crucial to use as few projection images as possible, due to radiation damage.","['1.
