In addition, because of the high porosity (low density), scars due to clogging are also less likely to be formed. Moreover, since the polishing pad of the present invention is softer than polishing pads having polishing layers molded by conventional dry methods, the polishing pad is excellent also in polishing rate and polishing uniformity. Meanwhile, since the polishing pad of the present invention is dry-molded, the polishing pad has a lower wearing rate of the polishing surface than the wet-molded polishing pads. Hence, the polishing pad of the present invention can retain a constant polishing state for a long period. Accordingly, although dry-molded, the polishing pad of the present invention can be advantageously used for both primary processing and finish processing.

The frequency generator employs a third harmonic boosting technique to increase the third harmonic at the output of the oscillator. The oscillator generates both 20 GHz fundamental and a significant amount of the third harmonic at 60 GHz and avoids the need for a frequency divider operating at 60 GHz. The undesired fundamental harmonic at 20 GHz is rejected by the good fundamental harmonic rejection ratio (HRR) inherent in the oscillator buffer stage while the 60 GHz component is amplified to the output. The fundamental harmonic is further suppressed by active cancellation by properly combining the two outputs.
