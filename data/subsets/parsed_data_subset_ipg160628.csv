09376542,20160628,B2,,High solids and low viscous aqueous slurries of calcium carbonate-comprising materials with improved rheological stability under increased temperature,The present invention concerns aqueous slurries with improved rheo logical stability under increased temperature. The slurries comprise a calcium carbonate containing material and at least one comb polymer.,"As can be seen from Table 6 the slurry of comparative Example 1 became highly viscous when increasing the temperature. At a temperature of 90 C. the slurry had a viscosity of >1000 mPas and, thus, there would be a high risk of blocking and damaging production units. This is impressively demonstrated by the slurry of Example 4. Once the slurry was heated to boiling temperature, the slurry became thick and blocked the pump (see Table 7). The up-concentration procedure had to be stopped. This problem was not observed with the inventive slurries 2, 3 and 5. In contrast to Example 4, the inventive slurry of example 5 did not became thick and, therefore, did not block the pump when heated to boiling temperature. Even after 4 h the viscosity of the slurry at the up-concentration temperature of 95 C. was below 500 mPas. Comparative Example 6 seems to have a very low viscosity at first sight. The value at 40 C. is 40 mPas and at 90 C. 28 mPas. However, this is caused by the fact, that the specific charge of the polymer used in example 6 is 931 C/g and, therefore, very high.

For example, although the above description refers to a single forbidden range (and a single target frequency) being avoided, by controlling the behavior of a PFM switch mode power converter, the same approach may be used for multiple target frequencies such that multiple, non-overlapping forbidden ranges are avoided. In that case, the same frequency monitor and parameter control decision logic may be re-used, by simply changing, for example, the value of the trimmed current source and/or the window comparator reference voltages, to match the new forbidden range. It can be expected that there may be several sub-systems operating at different clock frequencies that are particularly sensitive to EMI from the power converter. Some of these may lead to multiple, overlapping forbidden ranges being defined, in which case the frequency monitor described above may be modified with additional comparators in order to simultaneously detect incursions into the overlapping forbidden ranges.
