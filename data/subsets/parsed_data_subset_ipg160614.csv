According to the standard KS M 2163, the tests were conducted for the following items: a) cleaning ability, b) noise generation, and c) wear state. As can be seen from Table 4, the evaluation results for the detailed items were as follows: a) The vehicle-glass cleaning fluid was sprayed on the glass of a vehicle, and then the conspicuity therefrom was compared with that of the control fluid. As a result, the vehicle-glass cleaning fluids containing an anionic surfactant and tartaric acid and the comparative examples (that is, vehicle-glass cleaning fluids not containing an anionic surfactant and tartaric acid) showed equivalent levels of result values without abnormality.

The noise generated here was observed. The aforementioned procedure was executed a total of five times with 20 times per each execution. As a result, the vehicle-glass cleaning fluids containing an anionic surfactant and tartaric acid did not cause noise, but the comparative examples (vehicle-glass cleaning fluids not containing an anionic surfactant and tartaric acid) caused noise two times and three times, respectively. c) The vehicle-glass cleaning fluid was sprayed after the glass of the vehicle was cleanly wiped and dried, and then the wiper blade was operated.

09367203,20160614,B1,,User interface techniques for simulating three-dimensional depth,"Systems and approaches provide for user interfaces (UIs) that are based on a user's viewing angle and/or motion and orientation of the computing device. The UI elements of the framework can be rendered based on head tracking and/or device motion/orientation data to provide a user the impression that the UI elements exist in an environment having three-dimensional (3D) depth. To further enhance the impression of 3D depth, UI elements positioned at depths perceived to be closer to the user can cast shadows upon UI elements positioned at depths appearing to be further away from the user.

09370129,20160614,B2,,Cable support shield termination device,"Methods and devices for providing strain relief in a region between a cable clamp and a shield termination ring of a wire harness termination assembly in a vibration environment. The devices are in the form of a shield termination ring having an extended member joined to or integrally formed with a curved cable clamp insert. The extended member in turn may be joined to or integrally formed with the shield termination ring. The purpose of the extended arm and curved cable clamp insert is to provide support to the portion of the wire harness disposed between the cable clamp and the shield termination ring, thereby reducing shield braid and wire insulation fatigue in that area.","As used in the claims, the term joined should be construed to encompass at least the following terms: fixedly coupled, connected, fastened, bonded (e.g., glued), and welded.","['1.
