The contact portion has a storage portion provided on a side of the recording portion and configured to store an ink, and a protruding portion is provided between both ends in a width direction intersecting the transporting direction of the storage portion, and which is protruded toward the recording section, and an upper end of the protruding portion is the highest in the contact portion.', ' CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION The present application is a divisional application of prior U.S. application Ser. No. 13/629,937, filed Sep. 28, 2012, which claims priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2011-259496, filed on Nov. 28, 2011, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to an ink-jet recording apparatus which records an image on a sheet upon suppressing lifting-off of the sheet from a platen. 2. Description of the Related Art An ink-jet recording apparatus which includes a platen which supports a sheet transported in a transporting direction (hereinafter, transporting direction), and which carries out image recording by jetting ink droplets from a recording section onto a sheet on the platen, has hitherto been known. In such type of ink-jet recording apparatuses, there is an apparatus which includes a contact portion which suppresses or inhibits lifting off of a sheet from the platen. The contact portion is arranged between the platen and the recording section, and suppresses the lifting-off of a sheet from the platen by contacting with the sheet which is transported. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Reducing a distance between the platen and the recording section shortens a distance between the sheet on the platen and the recording section, and an accuracy of image recording is improved. However, when the distance between the platen and the recording section is made smaller, the contact portion comes closer to the recording section. As the contact portion comes closer to the recording section, there is a possibility of the contact portion and the recording section making a contact. Sometimes, ink is adhered to the recording section by ink mist, etc. When the ink is adhered to the recording section, the ink is adhered to the contact portion due to the contact between the recording section and the contact portion. As the ink is adhered to the contact portion, the ink moves to a rear surface of the platen from a side of the recording section upon running down a front surface of the contact portion, and makes the sheet dirty. The present teaching is made in view of the abovementioned circumstances, and an object of the present invention is to provide an ink-jet recording apparatus in which it is possible to suppress the ink adhered to the contact portion from flowing toward the platen. According to an aspect of the present teaching, there is provided an ink-jet recording apparatus includes: a recording portion configured to jet ink droplets from nozzles onto a sheet; and a contact portion provided between the nozzles and an upstream end of the recording portion in the transporting direction, and configured to come into contact with an upper surface of the sheet, wherein the contact portion has a storage portion provided on a side of the recording portion, and configured to store an ink, and a protruding portion which provided between both ends in a width direction intersecting the transporting direction of the storage portion and being protruded toward the recording portion, and wherein an upper end of the protruding portion is the highest in the contact portion. The sheet is transported so that the lift-off of the sheet from the platen is suppressed by the contact portion which comes into contact with an upper surface of the sheet. When at least one of the recording portion and the contact portion is displaced in a direction of the recording portion and the contact portion coming closer, the contact portion comes into contact with the recording portion at the protruding portion. When the contact portion comes into contact with the recording portion, in a case in which an ink is adhered to the recording portion, the ink is adhered to the protruding portion. The ink adhered to the protruding portion flows toward the storage portion running down the protruding portion, and is accumulated in the storage portion. Due to the storage portion, the ink is suppressed from flowing to a lower-surface side of the contact portion.

recording section onto a sheet on the platen has hitherto been known in such type of ink-jet recording apparatuses there is an apparatus which includes a contact portion which suppresses or inhibits lifting off of a sheet from the platen the contact portion is arranged between the platen and the recording section and suppresses the lifting-off of a sheet from the platen by contacting with the sheet which is transported summary of the invention reducing a distance between the platen and the recording section shortens a distance between the sheet on the platen and the recording section and an accuracy of image recording is improved however when the distance between the platen and the recording section is made smaller the contact portion comes closer to the recording section as the contact portion comes closer to the recording section there is a possibility of the contact portion and the recording section making a contact sometimes ink is adhered to the recording section by ink mist etc when the ink is adhered to the recording section the ink is adhered to the contact portion due to the contact between the recording section and the contact portion as the ink is adhered to the contact portion the ink moves to a rear surface of the platen from a side of the recording section upon running down a front surface of the contact portion and makes the sheet dirty the present teaching is made in view of the abovementioned circumstances and an object of the present invention is to provide an ink-jet recording apparatus in which it is possible to suppress the ink adhered to the contact portion from flowing toward the platen according to an aspect of the present teaching there is provided an ink-jet recording apparatus includes a recording portion configured to jet ink droplets from nozzles onto a sheet and a contact portion provided between the nozzles and an upstream end of the recording portion in the transporting direction and configured to come into contact with an upper surface of the sheet wherein the contact portion has a storage portion provided on a side of the recording portion and configured to store an ink and a protruding portion which provided between both ends in a width direction intersecting the transporting direction of the storage portion and being protruded toward the recording portion and wherein an upper end of the protruding portion is the highest in the contact portion the sheet is transported so that the lift-off of the sheet from the platen is suppressed by the contact portion which comes into contact with an upper surface of the sheet when at least one of the recording portion and the contact portion is displaced in a direction of the recording portion and the contact portion coming closer the contact portion comes into contact with the recording portion at the protruding portion when the contact portion comes into contact with the recording portion in a case in which an ink is adhered to the recording portion the ink is adhered to the protruding portion the ink adhered to the protruding portion flows toward the storage portion running down the protruding portion and is accumulated in the storage portion due to the storage portion the ink is suppressed from flowing to a lower-surface side of the contact portion brief description of the drawings detailed description of the preferred embodiments
