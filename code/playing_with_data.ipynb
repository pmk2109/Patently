       "'cross reference to related application the present application is a divisional application of prior u.s application ser no 13/629,937 filed sep 28 2012 which claims priority from japanese patent application no 2011-259496 filed on nov 28 2011 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety background of the invention 1 field of the invention the present invention relates to an ink-jet recording apparatus which records an image on a sheet upon suppressing lifting-off of the sheet from a platen 2 description of the related art an ink-jet recording apparatus which includes a platen which supports a sheet transported in a transporting direction hereinafter transporting direction and which carries out image recording by jetting ink droplets from a recording section onto a sheet on the platen has hitherto been known in such type of ink-jet recording apparatuses there is an apparatus which includes a contact portion which suppresses or inhibits lifting off of a sheet from the platen the contact portion is arranged between the platen and the recording section and suppresses the lifting-off of a sheet from the platen by contacting with the sheet which is transported summary of the invention reducing a distance between the platen and the recording section shortens a distance between the sheet on the platen and the recording section and an accuracy of image recording is improved however when the distance between the platen and the recording section is made smaller the contact portion comes closer to the recording section as the contact portion comes closer to the recording section there is a possibility of the contact portion and the recording section making a contact sometimes ink is adhered to the recording section by ink mist etc when the ink is adhered to the recording section the ink is adhered to the contact portion due to the contact between the recording section and the contact portion as the ink is adhered to the contact portion the ink moves to a rear surface of the platen from a side of the recording section upon running down a front surface of the contact portion and makes the sheet dirty the present teaching is made in view of the abovementioned circumstances and an object of the present invention is to provide an ink-jet recording apparatus in which it is possible to suppress the ink adhered to the contact portion from flowing toward the platen according to an aspect of the present teaching there is provided an ink-jet recording apparatus includes a recording portion configured to jet ink droplets from nozzles onto a sheet and a contact portion provided between the nozzles and an upstream end of the recording portion in the transporting direction and configured to come into contact with an upper surface of the sheet wherein the contact portion has a storage portion provided on a side of the recording portion and configured to store an ink and a protruding portion which provided between both ends in a width direction intersecting the transporting direction of the storage portion and being protruded toward the recording portion and wherein an upper end of the protruding portion is the highest in the contact portion the sheet is transported so that the lift-off of the sheet from the platen is suppressed by the contact portion which comes into contact with an upper surface of the sheet when at least one of the recording portion and the contact portion is displaced in a direction of the recording portion and the contact portion coming closer the contact portion comes into contact with the recording portion at the protruding portion when the contact portion comes into contact with the recording portion in a case in which an ink is adhered to the recording portion the ink is adhered to the protruding portion the ink adhered to the protruding portion flows toward the storage portion running down the protruding portion and is accumulated in the storage portion due to the storage portion the ink is suppressed from flowing to a lower-surface side of the contact portion brief description of the drawings detailed description of the preferred embodiments

       "<para id=\"P-00004\" lvl=\"0\"><ptext><pdat>The testing of bone tissue characteristics such as bone mineral density (BMD) in living humans is widely utilized in present-day medical practice to determine whether and to what extent a patient has osteoporosis or other bone disease. One convenient and effective way of testing bone tissue characteristics is by transmitting ultrasonic energy through a bone in a patient's limb or extremity, between ultrasonic transducers respectively disposed on opposite sides of the limb or extremity, while the transducers and bone-containing limb or extremity are stably held in stationary, predetermined relation to each other in a support or frame. It is currently preferred, in at least many instances, to perform ultrasonic testing on the heel bone (os calcis, or calcaneal bone), with the foot of the patient positioned in the support and the ultrasonic transducers facing each other on opposite sides of the heel.</pdat></ptext></para>\n",
       "<para id=\"P-00005\" lvl=\"0\"><ptext><pdat>For effective coupling of ultrasonic energy to the heel, some testing systems (wet systems) include a tank or container of liquid in which the foot is immersed, and which is in contact with the transducers. Dry systems have also been developed, in which a pair of pads constituted of a suitable polymer or filled with a liquid coupling medium such as a gel (the term “liquid” herein embracing gels) are respectively disposed between the heel and the two transducers, each pad being in contact with and somewhat compressed between its associated transducer and the heel.</pdat></ptext></para>\n",
       "<para id=\"P-00006\" lvl=\"0\"><ptext><pdat>The transducers employed are devices for converting electrical energy to ultrasonic energy and vice versa. Thus, one of the transducers is energized electrically to generate ultrasonic energy which is transmitted through the heel or other body portion containing the bone being tested and received by the other of the transducers. The receiving transducer in turn generates an electrical signal in response to the received ultrasonic energy which has traversed the bone. This electrical signal is detected by appropriate electrical circuitry and utilized in deriving a value representing, for example, the speed of sound (SOS) through the bone or broadband ultrasonic attenuation (BUA) by the bone. Such values can be correlated with medically significant bone characteristics such as BMD.</pdat></ptext></para>\n",
       "<para id=\"P-00007\" lvl=\"0\"><ptext><pdat>In conventional systems as heretofore known, each of the ultrasonic transducers which produce and receive the ultrasonic energy is typically a ceramic piezoelectric crystal heavily damped with a composite backing and/or tuned to obtain the desired broadband frequency response. These transducers are extremely labor-intensive to manufacture, requiring an extensive amount of machining, gluing and compressing in production. Because of the many manufacturing steps, the nature of the ceramic crystal and the damping backing, the final product is extremely variable in nature. This variability is manifested in frequency response, amplitude and ultrasonic wave shape.</pdat></ptext></para>\n",

Preferably, both transducers are piezoelectric copolymer transducers.

', '   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to FSK (frequency shift keying). More particularly, it relates to a noise-removing technology upon FSK demodulation. One example of the FSK demodulation is Caller ID service which is one of telephone services. In this service, FSK is used for performing data communication of the caller ID. 2. Description of the Prior Art As one of telephone services, there is a Caller ID service. In this service, data communication of the caller ID is performed according to the BELL 202 standard and the CCITT V.23 standard. In these standards, for the noise present on a telephone line, the ratio of a FSK signal to a noise is defined as 20 &lsqb;dB&rsqb;. Whereas, the amplitude of the FSK signal to be received is defined as 32 &lsqb;dBm&rsqb; to 12 &lsqb;dBm&rsqb;. For this reason, in the data communication of the caller ID, the noise amplitude to be removed varies according to the FSK signal amplitude. As a demodulation method of FSK, there is a zero-crossing method. With the zero-crossing method, the interval between the crossings across the line at an amplitude of zero of the FSK signal, i.e., the time of half period is determined to discriminate between two carrier frequencies. With such a method for determining the half period, the amplitude level of the FSK signal is not involved in demodulation. Therefore, the noise in the same frequency band as the FSK signal is demodulated. For preventing the noise from being demodulated as a signal, in the prior-art method, the noise amplitude level to be removed is preset, and an amplitude smaller than the amplitude level is regarded as a noise, and removed. However, even in this case, when the noise amplitude also varies in accordance with the input signal amplitude as the Caller ID service, it is not possible to completely remove the noise, or even the FSK signal which should not be removed is erroneously removed. When the Caller ID is transmitted, a noise is also present together with the FSK signal. However, with a prior-art method, it is not possible to discriminate between the FSK signal and the noise. As a result, the noise has been erroneously demodulated. Further, with the prior-art method, it is not possible to detect the completion of FSK. With the prior-art method, whether it is the Caller ID or a noise has been judged based on the demodulation result. With the prior-art method, for removing a noise from the FSK signal, the component having a smaller amplitude than the preset amplitude is removed as the noise. Such a prior-art method may not be applicable to removal of the noise present during a period in which the FSK signal is not transmitted, and varying in amplitude in accordance with the FSK signal amplitude. This is for the following reason. The minimum amplitude of the signal may be smaller than the amplitude of the noise at the time of the maximum signal amplitude. In this case, not only the noise but also even the signal are removed. Further, with digital FSK, respective digital values of 1 and 0 are set to correspond to either of two different frequencies, however, the two signals may be different in amplitude from each other. In such a case, the FSK signal having a smaller amplitude in accordance with the FSK signal amplitude may be erroneously removed as a noise. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Object of the Invention An object of the present invention is to provide a FSK demodulation system capable of changing the noise amplitude to be removed in accordance with the amplitude level of the input signal. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A FSK demodulation system of the present invention has a means for comparing two preset values across 0, a positive side level shift amount and a negative side level shift amount, with an inputted amplitude level; and a demodulation means for performing demodulation based on the comparison result.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION A digital FSK demodulation system 100 which is a first example of the present invention will be described by reference to FIG. 1. In the digital FSK demodulation system 100, an analog input signal 1 is inputted to an amplifier 2 having a function of amplifying or attenuating the amplitude, and a function of a low-pass filter. An output from the amplifier 2 is converted into a digital value by an A/D converter 3 (A/D). Then, by a digital bandpass filer 4 (digital BPF) whose passband is the FSK signal frequency band, the frequency component in the stopband of the digital BPF 4 contained in the signal is attenuated. The FSK signal which passed through the BPF 4, and the noise of the frequency component in the passband of the digital BPF 4 are inputted to an amplitude measurement/noise removal block 5. In the amplitude measurement/noise removal block 5, the amplitude level to be removed as a noise is preset. The amplitude measurement/noise removal block 5 measures the inputted signal amplitude, and changes the preset amplitude level to be removed according to the measurement result. As a result, it becomes possible to detect that the FSK signal has not been transmitted any longer after inputting of the FSK signal. A digital FSK demodulation block 6 demodulates the output from the amplitude measurement/noise removal block 5. The digital FSK demodulation block 6 is the circuit for performing the demodulation even when there exists a noise in the same frequency band as the FSK signal, and within the range defined under the standard simultaneously with the FSK signal, and outputs demodulation data 7. Thus, in the present invention, the removable noise amplitude level is preset, and after measuring the input signal amplitude, the setting of removable noise amplitude level is automatically changed according to the amplitude level. As a result, it is possible to remove even the noise changing in amplitude in accordance with the change in FSK signal amplitude. Then, a description will be given to a demodulation method by means of the digital FSK demodulation system 100. With FSK (frequency shift keying), binary digital values of 1 and 0 are set to respectively correspond to mutually different frequencies, and transmitted with continuous phase at a prescribed transmission rate to perform data communication. As shown in FIG. 2, the frequency of a Mark signal corresponding to data 1 is referred to as fmark 8, and the frequency of a Space signal corresponding to data 0 is referred to as fspace 9. Further, the transmission rate is referred to as fbaud 10. As shown in FIG. 3, with the digital FSK demodulation system 100, the positive side level shift amount 11 and the negative side level shift amount 12 are set. This is for removing the signal having an amplitude level within the range between the positive side level shift amount 11 and the negative side level shift amount 12 as a noise. The amplitude measurement/noise removal block 5 compares the positive side level shift amount 11 and the negative side level shift amount 12 with the inputted amplitude level to output a flag. The flag which becomes 1 for the amplitude larger than the positive side level shift amount 11 is referred to as upper 13. The flag which becomes 1 for the amplitude smaller than the negative side level shift amount 12 is referred to as lower 14. Incidentally, the signal waveform shown in FIG. 3 is illustrated in analog waveform. However, the signal actually outputted from the digital BPF 4 is the discrete value sampled at a given frequency. The digital FSK demodulation block 6 which received the flags upper 13 and lower 14 from the amplitude measurement/noise removal block 5 generates a sampling point count value 15, and outputs a demodulation result based on the sampling point count value 15. As for the sampling point count value 15, the counter value is cleared at the leading edge of the upper 13 or at the leading edge of the lower 14, and the sampling frequency of the digital BPF 4 is used as a count clock. If the sampling point count value 15 is not less than a prescribed threshold value for judgment 16 at the leading edge of the upper 13 or the lower 14, it is judged as the Mark signal. Conversely, if the sampling point count value 15 is not more than the threshold value for judgment 16, it is judged as the Space signal. The comparison result between the sampling point count value 15 and the threshold value for judgment 16 is outputted as a fskdata 17. In other words, the digital FSK demodulation system 100 measures the interval between the leading edge of the upper 13 and the leading edge of the lower 14, and thereby measures the half period of the input signal, to perform demodulation. A description will be now given to a method for calculating the threshold value for judgment 16 by taking as an example the case where the digital FSK demodulation system 100 is applied to FSK defined in CCITT V.23 and BELL 202. In CCITT V.23, fmark 8&equals;1200 &lsqb;Hz&rsqb;, fspace 9&equals;2200 &lsqb;Hz&rsqb;, and fbaud 10&equals;1200 &lsqb;Hz&rsqb;. Herein, assuming that the sampling frequency of the digital BPF 4 is 56000 &lsqb;Hz&rsqb;, the number of sampling points contained in the half period of the Mark signal during the period in which one data is transmitted is 56000/1200/2&equals;about 23. Whereas, the number of sampling points contained in the half period of the Space signal during the same period is 56000/2200/2&equals;about 13. Accordingly, a number of sampling points of 18 which is the intermediate value between the two values is set to be used as the threshold value for judgment 16 for the Mark signal and the Space signal. The digital FSK demodulation system 100 includes a resistor for storing the threshold value for judgment 16. It is noted that the fskdata 17 is the demodulation result with no consideration given to the transmission rate. Therefore, for precise demodulation, the system 100 is further required to have a counter for the transmission rate for measuring the transmission rate of one data, and a threshold value for the transmission rate, as well as to include a correction circuit for the error generated at the time of counting of the transmission rate. Then, the change in level shift amount will be schematically described by reference to FIG. 4. The amplitude measurement/noise removal block 5 includes a resistor for presetting the initial value of the noise amplitude to be removed. In this resistor, as the initial value on the positive side of the noise amplitude level to be removed, a positive side level shift amount initial value 18 is preset. Whereas, as the initial value on the negative side of the noise amplitude level to be removed, a negative side level shift amount initial value 19 is preset. Each of periods T1 and T3 is the period for only a noise, and a period T2 is the period in which the FSK signal is present. At first, in the period T1, the amplitude of the noise exceeds the level shift amounts 18 and 19. At this time, the amplitude measurement/noise removal block 5 does not remove the noise. The digital FSK demodulation block 6 executes a FSK demodulation operation on the noise. Further, the digital FSK demodulation block 6 compares the demodulation result with a prescribed pattern. When both are in agreement with each other, the digital FSK demodulation block 6 instructs the amplitude measurement/noise removal block 5 to change the level shift amounts. In FIG. 4, the level shift amounts are changed within the period T2. In the period T3, the amplitude measurement/noise removal block 5 determines whether the noise should be removed or not based on level shift amounts 20. By changing the level shift amounts in this manner, it is possible to remove the noise within a range interposed between the positive and negative level shift amounts 20 after changing. Then, by taking the Bellcore standard (SR-TSV-002476) which is one standard of the Caller ID service as an example, the timing at which the caller ID is transmitted will be described by reference to FIG. 5. The state before the instant when a calling party lifts an earphone is referred to as an ON-HOOK state 21, and the state after lifting of the earphone is referred to as an OFF-HOOK state 22. The signal for notifying a switching system that the calling party has lifted the earphone, and the phone goes into the OFF-HOOK state 22 is a calling signal 23. A dial tone 24 is transmitted from the switching system which received the calling signal 23 to the calling party. The calling party transmits a dialing code 25 of the called party to the switching system. A first call signal 27 is transmitted from the switching system to the called party, and a caller ID 28 of the calling party is transmitted to the called party subscribing to the Caller ID service. During transmission of the call signal to the called party, a ringing tone 26 is transmitted to the calling party. The called party lifts the earphone, so that the calling party and the called party are in communication. Further, when the calling party subscribes the service which enables the subscriber to receive an interrupt call from a third party while being on line, after the third party transmitted the dialing code of the called party to the switching system, CAS32 is transmitted from the switching system to the called party, which notifies the called party telephone that there has been the interrupt call from the third party. The CAS32 signals are the signals having two frequency components to be simultaneously transmitted, wherein the signal having a higher frequency is referred to as CAS-H, and the signal having a lower frequency is referred to as CAS-L. The frequency of the CAS-H is 2750 &lsqb;Hz&rsqb;, and the frequency of the CAS-L is 2130 &lsqb;Hz&rsqb;. The called party telephone which received the CAS32 transmits ACK33 to the switching system. The switching system which received the ACK33 transmits the caller ID of the third party to the called party. When the called party decides to receive a call from the third party, a call change-over signal is transmitted to the switching system, so that communication between the called party and the third party is achieved. The configuration of the caller ID 28 to be transmitted will be described by reference to FIG. 6. The caller ID 28 is transmitted from after the first call signal 27 until before the second call signal 29. The caller ID 28 is made up of a channel acquisition signal 35, a sequence of Mark signals 36, and caller ID data 37. The channel acquisition signal 35 is the signal transmitted in such a manner as to be alternately data 1 and 0. The sequence of Mark signals 36 are the signals transmitted in such a manner as to be continuously data 1. Further, in the service for displaying the caller ID 28 of a third party at the time of an interrupt call from the third party during communication between two parties, first, the CAS32 indicative of the interrupt from the third party is transmitted, and the ACK33 indicative of reception thereof is transmitted backed to the switching system. Then, the caller ID 28 is transmitted in a configuration of the sequence of Mark signals 36 and the caller ID data 37. Referring to FIG. 7, a description will be given to the conditions under which the positive and negative level shift amounts are changed. Herein, FSK demodulation after the first call signal 27 will be described as an example. The digital FSK demodulation block 6 starts to operate in response to a signal from a circuit for detecting the call signal. However, there is a period in which only a noise is transmitted after the start of demodulation operation. When the amplitude of the noise in this period exceeds the initial values of the positive and negative level shift amounts, the positive and negative level shift amounts are changed. The periods which should be discriminated from the period in which only a noise is transmitted include channel acquisition loss 38 and Mark signal loss 39. After the period of only a noise, the FSK signal is transmitted in the order of the channel acquisition signal 35, the sequence of Mark signals 36, and the caller ID data 37 (not shown). The channel acquisition loss 38 is generated due to interruption of the channel acquisition signal 35 during transmission. Similarly, the Mark signal loss 39 is generated due to interruption of the sequence of Mark signals 36 during transmission. For example, if the time regarded as the channel acquisition loss 38 is preset, and at the time of detecting the channel acquisition loss 38, how long the period lasts is determined, it becomes possible to discriminate the period from a noise. In the initial period of only a noise, the noise has been unremovable. Therefore, it is possible to determine the inputted amplitude level before generation of the channel acquisition loss 38, and to change the level shift amounts into the value in accordance with the amplitude, it is possible to detect the channel acquisition loss 38. At the time of an interrupt from a third party, the channel acquisition signal 35 is not transmitted. Therefore, such a configuration as to enable the following operation is implemented. Namely, even during the period in which the sequence of Mark signals 36 are transmitted, it is possible to determine the inputted amplitude level, and to change the level shift amounts according to the amplitude. Referring to FIG. 8, a description will be given to the timing for changing the level shift amounts. When the demodulation result from the digital FSK demodulation block 6 is in agreement with either of the channel acquisition signal 35 and the sequence of Mark signals, the amplitude measurement/noise removal block 5 changes the level shift amounts according to the inputted amplitude. When the channel acquisition signal 35 is demodulated at the FSK demodulation circuit, a 10-bit shift register has a pattern of 1010101010. A counter 45 for counting the number of data items is the counter which is cleared to 0 when 10 data items have been transmitted to the shift register, and restarts counting. At the timing at which the shift register value is 1010101010 when the value of the counter 45 for counting the number of data items becomes 9, the change in level shift amounts according to the inputted amplitude is performed. Similarly, for the sequence of Mark signals, at the timing at which the value of the shift register is 1111111111 when the value of the counter 45 for counting the number of data items becomes 9 at the tenth data item wherein it counts the first data item as 0, the change in level shift amounts according to the inputted amplitude is performed. During the period in which the caller ID is transmitted, the change in level shift amounts is not performed. This is for preventing the FSK demodulation from being erroneously performed by the change in level shift amounts. The change in level shift amounts is made until the period of the sequence of Mark signals 36. Referring again to FIG. 8, a description will be given to a method for calculating the level shift amount. It is noted that the period in which one data item is transmitted is referred to as bit 43. The period in which 10 data items are transmitted is referred to as frame 44. The maximum value of the amplitude during the period bit 43 is referred to as bitmax 46. According to the standard of Bellcore (SR-TSV-002476), the S/N ratio of the FSK signal to a noise is defined as 20 &lsqb;dB&rsqb;. In other words, the amplitude of the FSK signal is 10 times the amplitude of the noise. Whereas, the FSK signal amplitude is defined as 36 &lsqb;dBm&rsqb; to 12 &lsqb;dBm&rsqb;. Therefore, at the time when the FSK signal amplitude is a maximum of 12 &lsqb;dBm&rsqb;, the noise amplitude is allowed to be up to 32 &lsqb;dBm&rsqb;. Assuming that the initial value of the level shift amount is set to be 32 &lsqb;dBm&rsqb;, and the signals having an amplitude smaller than this are set to be removed, the result is that the FSK signal is removed when the amplitude of the FSK signal is 36 &lsqb;dBm&rsqb;. For avoiding this, the initial value of the level shift amount is required to be set at such a level as not to remove the FSK signal. Further, according to the same standard, as for the ratio of the Mark signal amplitude to the Space signal amplitude (twist), the maximum value is defined as 10 &lsqb;dB&rsqb; wherein the case where the Mark signal is larger than the Space signal is defined as positive twist. Therefore, when the Mark signal amplitude is assumed to be 1, the space signal amplitude is about 0.3, and the noise amplitude is 0.1. Therefore, for example, it is possible to set the level shift amount at . If the positive and negative level shift amounts are set to be  of the bitmax 46 when the timing of changing the level shift amount has come after determining the bitmax 46, the amplitude of less than 0.25 is removed. At this time, the noise is removable, and at the same time, the FSK signal will not be removed even for the maximum twist. On example in accordance with a first example will be described by reference to FIG. 9. A microcomputer 48 which is one example includes therein the digital FSK demodulation system 100 as a FSK demodulation/CAS detection system 50. It has change-over switches (SW) 53 for allowing input of analog signals of two systems from external terminals 49 of the microcomputer 48. Which signal is used out of the signals from respective input terminals can be set by an operation mode setting register 62. The system 50 has an amplifier capable of adjusting the gain control by an external circuit. It is possible to respectively set gains for the analog inputs of two systems, and a change-over switch (SW) 54 is switched simultaneously with the change-over SW 53 of the analog input signal. An A/D converter 3 includes a secondary delta/sigma modulator 55 for converting the analog value of the output from the amplifier 2 into a 1-bit digital value, a first decimation filter 56, a second decimation filter 57, and a third decimation filter 58 for decreasing the sampling frequency of the output from the secondary delta/sigma modulator 55, and enhancing the precision. For FSK demodulation, the output from the second decimation filter 57 is used. Whereas, for CAS detection, the output from the third decimation filter 58 is used. The digital BPF 4 has 3 tap coefficients 59 of a tap coefficient for FSK to operate for FSK demodulation, a tap coefficient for CAS-H and a tap coefficient for CAS-L to operate for CAS detection. By switching these tap coefficients 59 between during the FSK demodulation operation and during the CAS detection operation, one digital BPF 4 is capable of performing functions of 3 characteristics. The output from the digital BPF 4 is inputted to the foregoing amplitude measurement/noise removal block 5. The output therefrom is inputted to a FSK demodulation/CAS detection block 60. In this block 60, the same circuit is shared between a circuit for performing FSK demodulation and a circuit for performing CAS detection. In order for the block 60 to perform respective functions, it has an operation mode setting register, which is controllable by a CPU. Further, it has a status register, which indicates a FSK transmission start request status, a FSK demodulation error status, and a FSK transmission error status. By generating an interrupt signal for the CPU, and reading the status register, it is possible to know the status of FSK demodulation. A FSKDATA transmission block 61 includes a buffer for holding 4 bytes of the demodulated FSK data. A second example of the present invention will be described. When compared with the first example, it is different therefrom in the method for measuring the amplitude of the input signal serving as a reference for determining what value each level shift amount is changed into. In the first example, the bitmax 46 within the frame 44 was set to be a reference value for changing of each level shift amount. In this case, if a noise in pulse with an unexpected amplitude is present with a shorter period than the frame 44, the level shift amount is changed based on the amplitude. The result may be that the FSK signal which should not be removed is removed. In contrast, in the second example, as shown in FIG. 10, the period in which one data item is transmitted is referred to as bit 43, and the period in which 10 data items are transmitted is referred to as frame 44. The maximum value of the amplitude in the period bit 43 is referred to as bitmax 46. The minimum value of the bitmax 46 in the period frame 44 is referred to as framemin 48. This framemin 48 is used as a reference for determining what value the level shift amount is changed into. This allows removal of even a noise having a shorter period than the frame 44. A third example of the present invention will be described. When compared with the first example, it is different therefrom in timing for changing the level shift amount. In the first example, when the 10-bit shift register has a pattern of 1010101010 or 1111111111, the level shift amount was changed. In contrast, in the third embodiment, as shown in FIG. 11, when an n-bit register has a pattern of 1010 . . . nth bit or 1111 . . . nth bit (n is a natural number), the level shift amount is changed. For example, if n is set to be a smaller value than 10, it is possible to change the level shift amounts at a shorter time interval. A fourth example of the present invention will be described. In the first example, the level shift amount was changed into  of the bitmax 46. In contrast, in the fourth embodiment, the amount of change of the level shift amount is not limited to  of the bitmax 46. A change is made into such a level shift amount as to remove the noise to be removed and not to remove the FSK signal which should not be removed. As a result, it becomes possible to remove the noise changing in amplitude in accordance with the FSK signal amplitude. A fifth example of the present invention will be described by reference to FIG. 12. This example is so configured that the noise removal of the first example is implemented by means of an analog circuit. An analog input signal 1 is inputted to an amplifier 64 having a function of amplifying or attenuating the amplitude, and a function of a low-pass filter. As for an output from the amplifier 64, by an analog bandpass filer 65 (analog BPF) whose passband is the FSK signal frequency band, the frequency component in the stopband of the analog BPF 65 contained in the signal is attenuated. The FSK signal which has passed through the analog BPF 65, and the noise of the frequency component in the passband of the analog BPF 65 are inputted to a small amplitude signal removing circuit 66. At the same time, it is inputted to a block 67 (input signal maximum amplitude measurement circuit) for measuring the maximum value of the input signal amplitude. The small amplitude removing circuit 66 has a function of converting the amplitude of not less than a given set amplitude (level shift amount) to the voltage corresponding to 1, and the amplitude of less than the level shift amount to the voltage corresponding to 0. It is the circuit capable of changing the level shift amount with reference to the amplitude maximum value determined at the input signal maximum amplitude measurement circuit 67. A sixth example of the present invention will be described by reference to FIG. 14. This example is the case where the present invention has been applied to demodulation of signals other than the FSK signal. The present invention is applicable to removal of the noise unremovable by a BPF or the like due to the same frequency band as the signal, as well as such a noise as to change in amplitude in accordance with the amplitude of the signal. For example, in the case where there is a necessity to detect whether a signal configured with given two frequencies such as DTMF is transmitted or not transmitted, as shown in FIG. 14, when the signals which passed digital BPFs 67 and 68 whose passbands are respective frequency bands include noises varying in amplitude in accordance with the signal amplitudes, it is possible to remove the noises by passing the signals through the amplitude measurement/noise removal blocks 71 and 72. Signal detection circuits 73 and 74 detect the respective signals being transmitted, and output a signal detection flag 75 indicating that the signals of two frequencies were simultaneously transmitted. The amplitude measurement/noise removal block has a register for arbitrarily setting the initial value of the level shift amount, and is capable of switching the amount of change of the level shift amount based on the bitmax 46. When the circuit shown in the sixth example is used for the CAS detection circuit, by configuring the circuit so as to allow switching of operation control between the FSK demodulation circuit shown in each example of the first to fifth examples and this CAS detection circuit, it is possible to unify the amplitude measurement/noise removal blocks of the present invention. In such a case, by setting the initial value of each level shift amount, and the amount of change of the level shift amount at values suitable to both during FSK demodulation operation and during CAS detection operation, it is possible to perform processings on the two signals. For the foregoing reason, the effect of allowing the reduction in circuit scale is produced. Further, also for the amplifier 2, the A/D 3, and the digital BPF 4, it is possible to share the same circuit between the FSK demodulation circuit and the CAS signal detection circuit. Therefore, it is possible to further reduce the circuit scale. As described above, the present invention was described based on the examples, which should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention. It is needless to say that changes and modifications may be made within the knowledge of those skilled in the art. In accordance with such a FSK demodulation system, it is possible to remove the noise changing in accordance with the FSK signal amplitude without removing the FSK signal which should not be removed even at the maximum twist. With a system not capable of removing the noise during the period in which no FSK signal is present, for example, during the period of the channel acquisition loss 38, when FSK demodulation is performed, and the signal which is not the channel acquisition 35 is transmitted after detecting the channel acquisition 35, the channel acquisition loss 38 must be judged based on the demodulation result. If the frequency of the noise is the same frequency as the channel acquisition 35, it is impossible to judge the signal as the channel acquisition loss 38 based on the demodulation result. With the noise removing method of the present invention, during the period in which no FSK signal is transmitted, judgment is not required to be made based on the demodulation result. It is possible to judge the presence or the absence of the FSK signal based on the FSK signal detection flag 40. Similarly, it is possible to know the case of the Mark signal loss 39 and the completion of transmission of the FSK signal based on the FSK signal detection flag 40. As a result, the load on a program is less. Further, it is possible to prevent the malfunction occurring when the noise frequency is equal to the FSK signal frequency. Although the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments, this description is not meant to be construed in a limiting sense.

No. 10/072,843, filed on Feb. 6, 2002, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,762,644 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/275,109, filed Mar. 13, 2001, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.     FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to transimpedance amplifiers, and more particularly to nested transimpedance amplifiers with an increased gain-bandwidth product. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A transimpedance amplifier (TIA) is a well-known type of electronic circuit. Referring now to FIG. 1, a TIA 100 includes an operational amplifier (opamp) 105 having a gain parameter (gm). The opamp 105 is connected in parallel to a resistor (Rf) 110. The input to the TIA 100 is a current (&Dgr;i) 115. The output of the TIA 100 is a voltage (&Dgr;vo) 120. Referring now to FIG. 2, the opamp 105 of the TIA 100 is replaced by a current source 205 and a transistor 210 having gain gm. The TIA 100 in FIGS. 1 and 2 is often referred to as a transconductance amplifier because it converts the input current &Dgr;i into the output voltage &Dgr;vo. Referring now to FIG. 3, a TIA 300 converts an input voltage (&Dgr;vi) 305 into an output voltage (&Dgr;vo) 310. The TIA 300 also includes a resistor 315 that is connected to a transistor 320. The TIA 300 is typically used in applications that require relatively low bandwidth. Referring now to FIG. 4, a TIA 400 converts an input voltage (&Dgr;vi) 405 into an output voltage (&Dgr;vo) 410. The TIA 400 includes a second opamp 415, which is connected in series to a parallel combination of a resistor (Rf) 420 and an opamp 425. The TIA 400 is typically used for applications having higher bandwidth requirements than the TIA 300. Ordinarily, the bandwidth of the TIA is limited to a fraction of a threshold frequency fT of transistor(s) that are used in the opamp(s). In the case of a bipolar junction transistor (BJT) such as a gallium-arsenide (GaAs) transistor, the bandwidth of the TIA is approximately equal to 10%-20% of fT. For metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) transistor(s), the bandwidth of the TIA is typically a few percent (i.e., approximately 2%-6%) of fT. Referring now to FIG. 5, a TIA 500 may be configured to operate differentially using two inputs of each opamp 502 and 504. One input 505 acts as a reference, in a similar manner as ground or virtual ground in a standard configuration TIA. The input voltage &Dgr;vi and the output voltage &Dgr;vo are measured as voltage differences between a reference input 505 and a second input 510. Feedback resistors 514 and 516 are connected across the inputs and the outputs of the opamp 504. Referring now to FIG. 6, one TIA application having a relatively high bandwidth requirement is that of an optical sensor. An optical sensor circuit 600 includes the opamp 105 and the resistor 110 of the TIA 100 that are coupled with a photodiode 605. The output of the photodiode 605 is a current Iphoto 610, which acts as an input to the TIA 100. Increasingly, applications require both high bandwidth and high gain. Examples include optical sensors, such as fiber optic receivers, and preamplifier writers for high-speed hard disk drives. Efforts to increase the gain-bandwidth product of TIAs have been made. For example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,114,913, which are hereby incorporated by reference, a boost current is used to increase the gain-bandwidth product in the TIA. Cascading TIA stages is also used in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,345,073 and 4,772,859, which are hereby incorporated by reference. Other improvements to TIAs are the subject of other patents, such as U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,084,478; 6,057,738; 6,037,841; 5,646,573; 5,532,471; 5,382,920; 5,010,588; 4,914,402; 4,764,732; 4,724,315; 4,564,818; and 4,535,233, which are hereby incorporated by reference. However, improving the gain-bandwidth product of TIAs continues to be a challenge for circuit designers.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The following description of the preferred embodiment(s) is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its application, or uses. The present invention addresses the need for increasing the gain-bandwidth product of TIAs. Improvements in the gain-bandwidth product are achievable by nesting a TIA within another TIA. In other words, additional circuit elements such as feedback resistors, capacitors and/or opamps are added on the input and/or output sides of the TIA. Referring now to FIGS. 7, 8, and 9, a nested TIA is constructed by adding opamps, feedback resistors and/or capacitors to a zero-order TIA. In FIGS. 10 and 11, a nested TIA may also be constructed to operate in a differential mode. Referring back to FIG. 7, a first-order nested TIA 700 is shown. Reference numbers from FIG. 4 are used in FIG. 7 to identify similar elements. The TIA 700 includes a conventional TIA 705 (also referred to herein as a zero-order TIA), an opamp 710, and a feedback resistor 715. The feedback resistor 715 may be a standard fixed-value resistor, a nonlinear variable resistor, or an MOS resistor. A capacitor 720 is also connected between an input of the TIA 700 and ground (or virtual ground). By nesting the TIA in this manner, improvements in the gain-bandwidth product may be realized. For example, the first-order nested TIA 700 that uses MOS transistors may achieve a bandwidth that is 10%-20% of the threshold frequency fT. This range represents a bandwidth that is approximately five to ten times greater than the bandwidth of the corresponding zero-order TIA. Referring now to FIGS. 12 and 13, graphs illustrating characteristic gain-bandwidth curves for a zero-order TIA and a first-order nested TIA, respectively, are shown. In general, a higher value of gain is associated with a lower value of bandwidth, and a lower value of gain is associated with a higher value of bandwidth. The gain A, defined as the output voltage &Dgr;vo divided by the input voltage &Dgr;vi, is typically on the order of a few hundred or a few thousand (i.e., approximately 102-103). A typical range of threshold frequency (fT) values for a 0.13 &mgr;m CMOS process is 30 GHz-40 GHz. In FIG. 12, three exemplary characteristic curves are shown. A high gain value yields a bandwidth value of approximately 1 GHz. A medium gain value increases the bandwidth to approximately 2 GHz. Other values of gain and bandwidth are possible. For example, a TIA may have a characteristic gain value that is higher than the maximum shown in FIG. 12 and a bandwidth that is less than 1 GHz. A TIA may have a characteristic gain value that is lower than the minimum gain value shown in FIG. 12 and a bandwidth that is greater than 2 GHz. As can be appreciated, the bandwidth varies as an inverse function of gain. This function may be referred to as the spread. The spread is greater for TIAs using MOS transistors than for TIAs using bipolar junction transistors (BJTs). Thus, the need to improve the TIA bandwidth performance is more pronounced with MOS transistors than with BJT transistors. The exemplary bandwidth values shown in FIG. 12 do not define upper and lower bandwidth bounds. In many practical applications, bandwidths on the order of 1 GHz or 2 GHz are too low. Many applications, such as an OC192 fiber optic receiver, require bandwidths on the order of 10 GHz. Preamplifiers for high-speed hard disk drives also typically require bandwidths that are on the order of several GHz. Referring now to FIG. 13, a first-order nested TIA at a typical gain value may have a bandwidth of approximately 10 GHz. Referring now to FIG. 8, a second-order nested TIA 800 builds upon the first-order nested TIA 700. Reference numbers from FIGS. 4 and 7 are used in FIG. 8 to identify similar elements. The second-order nested TIA 800 includes an opamp 805 at the input of the first-order nested TIA 700 and an opamp 810 at the output of the first-order nested TIA 700. An additional feedback resistor 815 is also added across the input of the opamp 805 and the output of the opamp 810. An exemplary gain-bandwidth curve that is produced using the second-order nested TIA 800 is shown in FIG. 14. For a typical gain value, a bandwidth of approximately 20 GHz may be achieved. Referring now to FIG. 9, higher-order nested TIAs may be constructed by adding additional opamps and feedback resistors. Reference numbers from FIGS. 4, 7 and 8 are used in FIG. 9 to identify similar elements. For example, a third-order nested TIA 900 includes opamps 905 and 910 and feedback resistor 915. It is possible to achieve higher values of either gain or bandwidth (or both) by repeating the technique of the present invention. However, the efficiency of the circuit decreases as additional nesting levels are added due to parasitic noise and increased power dissipation. In general, either the first-order nested TIA or the second-order nested TIA will usually provide sufficient performance. Referring now to FIG. 10, a differential mode first-order nested TIA 1000 is shown. Reference numbers from FIG. 5 are used in FIG. 10 to identify similar elements. An opamp 1002 is connected to the outputs of the opamp 504. Feedback resistors 1006 and 1008 are connected to inputs of the differential mode TIA 500 and to outputs of the opamp 1002. The gain-bandwidth product of the TIA is increased. Referring now to FIG. 11, a differential mode nth-order nested TIA 1100 is constructed in a manner that is similar to the nth-order nested TIA of FIG. 9. Reference numbers from FIGS. 5 and 10 are used in FIG. 11 to identify similar elements. Additional opamps 1104 and 1108 and feedback resistors 1112 are connected in a similar manner. The gain-bandwidth characteristics for differential mode TIAs are substantially similar to the gain-bandwidth characteristics shown in FIGS. 12-14. It is noted that the opamps used in the nested TIA may employ either bipolar junction transistors (BJTs), such as gallium-arsenide (GaAs) transistors, or metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) transistors, such as CMOS or BICMOS transistors. The preferred embodiments of the invention use MOS transistors due to practical considerations such as ease of manufacture and better power consumption characteristics.

', '   FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to signal processing and is particularly applicable but not limited to circuits for amplifying amplitude and phase modulated signals. BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION The communications revolution of the 1990&apos;s has led to an increasing need for further and better means of transporting both data and voice communications. One offshoot of this revolution has been the burgeoning growth in wireless communications as more and more data is being transmitted by wireless means. For wireless handsets, wireless PDAs (personal digital assistants), and other wireless devices, one overarching concern is power consumptionthe less power a device consumes the more desirable it is. To this end, higher efficiency components, such as amplifiers, are desirable in these wireless devices. One type of architecture which was used in the past but has fallen out of recent favor is the so called Chireix architecture. First suggested by Henry Chireix in 1935, the technique also known as outphasing involves separately phase modulating two signals and recombining them in a combiner or combining network. By judiciously adjusting the phase modulation of the two signals, the combined resulting signal can become amplitude modulated as well as phase modulated. This technique enables the use of saturated amplifiers or switching amplifiers for amplitude modulated signals. Also called ampliphase by the RCA Corporation when used in some of their radio transmitters, the technique has recently fallen out of favor due to its seeming inapplicability when amplifying signals. Previous attempts used common forms of linear and saturating amplifiers such as Class A and Class AB amplifiers to try and amplify the two signals prior to their being combined. Unfortunately, these efforts have yielded unacceptable results as the resulting circuits were found to be insufficiently efficient. A Chireix based architecture, if properly working with sufficient efficiency, would offer advantages in not only power consumption but in other areas as well. Based on the above, there is a need for, methods or circuits which overcome or at least mitigate the drawback of the prior art. Such a solution should provide the advantages of a Chireix or outphasing architecture while providing sufficient amplification efficiency to be useful. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides circuits and methods for use in amplifying amplitude and phase modulated signals. A circuit uses a combiner with dual parallel signal amplifiers feeding it. The signal amplifiers have a low output impedance while the combiner does not provide any isolation between its inputs from the signal amplifiers. As in other Chireix architectures, the signals from the signal amplifiers are phase modulated prior to being fed to the combiner. The combiner then combines these two signals and, depending on how these two signals are phase modulated, the resulting output of the combiner is amplitude modulated as well as phase modulated. The signal amplifiers may be Class D or Class F amplifiers to provide high efficiency amplification of the signals. In a first aspect, the present invention provides a circuit for providing amplification to signals, the circuit comprising: a signal combiner; at least two signal amplifiers each receiving and amplifying a signal, said signal amplifiers being coupled in parallel to said combiner, each of said signal amplifiers acting as a voltage source and having a low output impedance, wherein each signal received and amplified by each of said signal amplifiers is phase modulated; outputs of each of said signal amplifiers are added by said combiner to produce a resulting signal; and amplitude modulation and phase modulation of said resulting signal from said combiner is achieved by an addition of said outputs. In a second aspect, the present invention provides a circuit for providing amplification to signals, the circuit comprising: at least two signal amplifiers each receiving and amplifying a signal and each producing an amplifier output and acting as a voltage source; and an signal combiner receiving each of said amplifier outputs in parallel, said signal combiner providing no isolation between said amplifier outputs, wherein each signal received and amplified by each of said signal amplifiers is phase modulated; said amplifier outputs are added by said combiner to produce a resulting signal; and amplitude modulation of said resulting signal from said combiner is achieved by an addition of said amplifier outputs.     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION A better understanding of the invention will be obtained by considering the detailed description below, with reference to the following drawings in which: FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an amplifier system using a Chireix architecture according to one aspect of the invention; FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a modified balanced magnetic transformer which may be used as a combiner in the system of FIG. 1; FIG. 3 is a block diagram of a modified Wilkinson combiner which may be used as a combiner in the system of FIG. 1; FIG. 4 is a block diagram of a Class-F power amplifier which may be used as an amplifier in the system of FIG. 1; and FIG. 5 is a block diagram of a Class-D power amplifier which may also be used as an amplifier in the system of FIG. 1.     DETAILED DESCRIPTION Referring to FIG. 1, a block diagram of a circuit 10 according to one aspect of the invention is illustrated. Signal amplifiers 20A, 20B feed a combiner 30 which produces an output 40. The signal amplifiers 20A, 20B are low output impedance amplifiers while the combiner 30 is a combiner appropriate for Chireix architectures. As in well known Chireix architectures, the signals received and amplified by the signal amplifiers 20a, 20B are phase modulated signals. These phase modulated signals, after being amplified by the signal amplifiers 20A, 20B, are combined or added by the combiner 30 to result in the output signal 40. By judiciously phase modulating the signals using appropriate phase modulators (not shown), the resulting signal 40 from the addition of the two signals is an amplitude modulated signal. Not only that, but the resulting signal is, in effect, an amplified version of a phase and an amplitude modulated signal. It should be noted that similar architectures as that illustrated in FIG. 1 have been attempted in the past. However, the low efficiency of the circuitry of the previous attempts stem from their use of low efficiency amplifiers such as Class A and Class AB amplifiers which have significant output impedances. Such linear and saturating amplifiers did not respond correctly to the dynamic adjustment of the load impedance being presented to them due to their significant output impedance. The dynamic nature of the load impedance is a result of the appropriate combiner for a Chireix architecture. Such an appropriate combiner not only reinserts the amplitude modulation to the resulting signal 40, it also provides a dynamic adjustment of the load impedance presented to each one of the signal amplifiers. This outphasing adjustment of the load impedance is such that the DC current through each signal amplifier decreases as the combined output amplitude decreases thereby maintaining high efficiency. Two appropriate combiners are illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 3. FIG. 2 illustrates a modified balanced magnetic transformer. As is known in the art, magnetic transformer combiners normally have a center tap-to-ground connection. In the modified transformer of FIG. 2, the tap-to-ground connection is not present. As can be seen, each of the two terminals 50A, 50B of an input winding 60 is to be coupled to a signal input or, in this case, a corresponding output of a corresponding signal amplifier. The output 70 is taken from one terminal of the output winding 80 while the other terminal 90 is coupled to ground 100. Another appropriate combiner is a modified Wilkinson combiner 110 as illustrated in FIG. 3. As is known, a Wilkinson combiner has an isolating resistor which is normally coupled between the inputs. In the modified Wilkinson combiner of FIG. 3, neither of the inputs 120A, 120B are coupled to the isolating resistor 130. This isolating resistor is effectively not present in the modified combiner of FIG. 3. The resistor 130 is provided merely for illustration. Other than this modification relating to the non-coupled resistor 130, the modified Wilkinson combiner 110 is similar in couplings and characteristics to other well known Wilkinson combiners. Regarding a proper choice of amplifiers for use in the block diagram of FIG. 1, it has been found by the inventors that either Class D or Class F power amplifiers can correctly respond to the dynamic nature of the load impedance as mentioned above. These Class D or Class F power amplifiers provide the desirably very low output impedances that allows the Chireix architecture to amplify both phase and amplitude modulated signals. Such a Class F power amplifier is illustrated in FIG. 4. This Class F amplifier 150 consists of a resistor load 160 coupled between ground 170 and a capacitor 180. An inductor 190 also coupled in series with the capacitor 180 forms a resonator which passes the fundamental harmonic of the signal to resistor load 160. Between the inductor 190 and ground are coupled, in series, a high pass filter 200 and another resistor 210. The resistor 210 has a much higher resistance value than the load resistor 160. A shorted, quarter wave transmission line 220 effectively shorts all even harmonic voltages while all odd harmonic voltages, including the fundamental, are passed on. A switching voltage input 230 is provided through a transistor 230. As is known, Class F amplifiers provide a good approximation to a voltage square-wave across the output terminals of a device by shorting all even-harmonic voltages and supporting all odd-harmonic voltages. As a result, the voltage waveform across the output terminals of a device contains only odd-harmonic components. In addition, this sorting of odd- and even-harmonics results in a current passing through the output terminals of the device that contains the fundamental, and only even-harmonic components. This shorting and supporting of harmonics is conveniently achieved with a shorted quarter-wave shunt-stub connected across the device&apos;s output terminals, a shown in FIG. 4. The stub will short the even harmonics and support the odd harmonics. Since each harmonic will contain only a voltage component or a current component, the device will not absorb power, except at the fundamental. In a practical situation, with a stub effectively shorting only the second harmonic voltage, and passing only the fundamental and third harmonic voltage, the power-added efficiency can be more than 85%. As an example of a Class D amplifier which may be used with the invention, FIG. 5 illustrates a block diagram of a Class D amplifier. As can be seen, the Class D amplifier is somewhat similar in structure to the Class F amplifier of FIG. 4. Inductor 190, capacitor 180 and resistor load 160 form a series circuit. The inductor 190 is coupled in series with one end of a transformer coil 240 while the other end of the transformer coil 240 is coupled to ground 170. The other transformer coil 250 is tapped by a voltage source (Vcc) coupled to a grounded capacitor 260. This other transformer coil 250 is coupled at each end to a switching voltage input 270A, 270B by way of transistors 280A, 280B. For such Class D (voltage switching) amplifiers, the active device passes no current between its output terminals when the voltage across its output terminals is at the voltage rail, and passes maximum current between its output terminals when the voltage across its output terminals is zero. As a result, the device does not absorb any power, and all power taken from the bias supply is converted into the output signal (100% power-added efficiency). It should be noted that the amplifiers in the amplifier pair 20A, 20B in FIG. 1 are to be of the same type. As such, if one amplifier 20A is a Class D amplifier, the other amplifier 20B should also be a Class D amplifier. Similarly, if one amplifier is a Class F amplifier, the other should also be a Class F amplifier. These two amplifier classes provide the requisite switch mode operation along with the very low output impedance. Other amplifier classes may have the switch mode operation but their output impedance is not of the desired very low value. It should also be noted that while the circuit of FIG. 1 only illustrates two signal amplifiers in parallel, multiple signal amplifiers may be used in parallel with an appropriate combiner. Such a configuration may use multiple parallel signal amplifiers of the same type or class, with all parallel signal amplifiers feeding a single multiple input port combiner. However, as noted above, these multiple signal amplifiers are to have the requisite switch mode operation and the low output impedance. Ideally, such a multiply parallel arrangement would only use Class D or Class F power amplifiers. A person understanding this invention may now conceive of alternative structures and embodiments or variations of the above all of which are intended to fall within the scope of the invention as defined in the claims that follow.

TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to the field of telecommunications and, in particular, to a network amplifier for a cable network. BACKGROUND Cable networks are a common medium for providing video, audio and other data or programming to subscribers. Conventionally, cable networks have one or more head ends that transmit signals to subscribers over a medium that includes coaxial cable. Cable networks typically provide subscribers with programming on a variety of channels. Each channel occupies a distinct frequency band on the coaxial cable. Signals transmitted over a coaxial cable tend to attenuate or decrease in signal strength or magnitude as the signals propagate away from the head end. Cable networks typically include network amplifiers that are placed at various locations in the cable network. The network amplifiers increase the magnitude of the signals to compensate for the attenuation due to the distance that the signals have propagated. The network amplifiers typically are formed of a number of circuit components that are interconnected on a printed circuit board. Once the amplifier is installed, the housing is sealed and the amplifier cannot be modified without opening the housing. Unfortunately, this may be a difficult and sometimes labor intensive process. Further, many of the circuit components can only be changed (e.g., the amount of attenuation provided by an attenuation pad) by replacing the part. For the reasons stated above, and for other reasons stated below which will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading and understanding the present specification, there is a need in the art for an improved network amplifier. SUMMARY The above mentioned problems with network amplifiers and other problems are addressed by the present invention and will be understood by reading and studying the following specification. A network amplifier is described which uses a microprocessor to control a variable attenuator and a variable equalizer to provide automatic gain control for the network amplifier.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings which form a part of the specification. The drawings show, and the detailed description describes, by way of illustration specific illustrative embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be used and logical, mechanical and electrical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense. I. First Embodiment of a Network Amplifier FIG. 1 is a block diagram of one embodiment of a network amplifier, indicated generally at 100, and constructed according to the teachings of the present invention. Network amplifier 100 includes a main signal path 102 between PORT 1 and PORT 2. The slope and gain of signal path 102 are controlled by automatic gain control circuit 104. Advantageously, automatic gain control circuit 104 includes microprocessor 120 that generates control signals as needed to adjust the gain and slope in signal path 102 to keep network amplifier 100 operating within specified parameters. A. The Signal Path Signal path 102 passes signals between PORT 1 and PORT 2 of network amplifier 100. Network amplifier 100 is a bi-directional amplifier. For simplicity, however, FIG. 1 shows only the forward portion of signal path 102. It is understood, that signal path 102 also includes a reverse path for passing upstream signals from PORT 2 to PORT 1. Signal path 102 provides amplification, with adjustable gain and slope or tilt, for RF signals transported between PORT 1 and PORT 2. Signal path 102 includes attenuator 106 that receives signals at PORT 1. Signal path 102 also includes amplifier stages 108 and 114 that are coupled in series with variable equalizer 110 and variable attenuator 112 between attenuator 106 and PORT 2. Variable equalizer 110 is constructed as shown and described in commonly assigned, co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 09/229,234 (the &apos;234 Application), entitled Variable Equalizer, and filed on Jan. 12, 1999. The &apos;234 Application is incorporated herein by reference. Essentially, variable equalizer 110 is controlled by at least one control signal from automatic gain control circuit 104 to provide a specified tilt setting for network amplifier 100. Variable attenuator 112 is constructed as shown and described in co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 60/142,267, entitled Variable Attenuator, and filed on Jul. 2, 1999 and co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 09/609,076, entitled Variable Attenuator, and filed on even date herewith. Variable attenuator 112 is controlled by at least one control signal from automatic gain control circuit 104 to provide a specified attenuation to the signals in signal path 102. Monitoring circuit 116 is coupled to signal path 102 to monitor RF signals. Advantageously, monitoring circuit 116 is constructed as shown and described in commonly assigned, co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 09/121,244 (the &apos;244 Application), entitled Circuits and Methods For A Monitoring Circuit in a Network Amplifier, and filed on Jul. 23, 1998. Monitoring circuit 116 thus monitors the level of signals in signal path 102 without insertion loss associated with a conventional directional coupler. However, it is understood that a conventional circuit, such as a directional coupler, could be used to monitor the signals in signal path 102 with insertion loss. B. Automatic Gain Control Circuit In one embodiment, automatic gain control circuit 104 controls the gain and slope of signal path 102 of network amplifier 100. Automatic gain control circuit 104 includes RF detector 118 that measures the level of signals from monitoring circuit 116. RF detector 118 is constructed as shown and described in co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 60/142,288, entitled RF Detector, and filed on Jul. 2, 1999 and U.S. application Ser. No. 09/607,832, entitled High Dynamic Range RF Detector with Temperature Compensation, and filed on even date herewith. Automatic gain control circuit 104 further includes processor 120, temperature sensor 122 and memory circuit 124. In one embodiment, processor 120, temperature sensor 122, and memory circuit 124 implement the functionality of the processor, sensor and memory of the RF detector shown and described in the cited Applications for RF detector 118. Thus, RF detector 118 may include a diode detector circuit that provides raw data to processor 120. Processor 120 processes the data from RF detector 118 to produce a value for the level of the signal in signal path 102 as described in the cited applications. In one embodiment, temperature sensor 122 comprises a thermistor. Processor 120 generates control signals for variable equalizer 110 and variable attenuator 112. These control signals are provided to variable equalizer 110 and variable attenuator 112 through digital to analog converters (DACs) 126. FIG. 2, described in more detail below, provides one embodiment of a process for generating the control signals for processor 120. C. Operation In operation, network amplifier 100 of FIG. 1 provides automatic gain control for signals in signal path 102. Downstream signals are received at port 1. The signals are amplified by amplifiers 108 and 114. Variable attenuator 112 and variable equalizer 110 also affect the amplification and other characteristics of signals on signal path 102. Monitoring circuit 116 monitors signals on signal path 102. These signals are provided to RF detector 118 that detects the level of the signals on signal path 102. The level information is provided to processor 120. Processor 120 uses the level information, a sensed temperature and data stored in memory 124 to create signals for adjusting the operation of variable equalizer 110 and variable attenuator 112 to assure that the signals provided at port 2 of network amplifier 100 fall within specified parameters. D. Process for Generating Control Signals FIG. 2 is a flow chart that illustrates one embodiment of a process for providing automatic gain control in a network amplifier according to the teachings of the present invention. The method begins at block 200. At block 202, the method reads reference settings of the network amplifier. For example, the method reads the current settings for control signals provided to a variable equalizer and a variable attenuator pad. Further, the method reads current operating conditions such as the environmental temperature of the network amplifier. Finally, in one embodiment, the method reads a value to determine whether the operation of the automatic gain control circuit is in automatic (auto) or manual mode. At block 204, the method determines whether the read value indicates auto or manual mode. When the value indicates auto mode, the method proceeds to automatically adjust the variable attenuator and variable equalizer circuits to assure that the network amplifier stays within prescribed operating conditions. At block 206, the method determines whether the level has changed by more than a specified amount for the signal in the signal path of the network amplifier. For example, in one embodiment, the method looks for a change of more than 0.2 dB in a pilot tone before returning a positive result for this inquiry. If the level has not changed, the method loops back to block 204 and monitors the level again. If the level of the signal in the signal path has changed by a sufficient amount, then the methods proceeds to block 208 and determines whether the pilot has been lost based on, for example, a change in the derivative of the level with respect to time. If so, the last good settings are applied from memory at block 209 and the method returns to block 204. Appropriate alarms are also sent back to the head end. If the pilot has not been lost, then the method proceeds to block 210 and begins the assessment procedure to determine new control signals for the variable equalizer and variable attenuator circuits. At block 210, the method determines whether the operating temperature of the network amplifier has changed. If the temperature has changed by at least a threshold amount, then the method knows that the characteristics of the cable plant have changed, e.g., the tilt of the cable changes with sufficient change in operating temperature. The method uses this change in temperature to generate control signals for the variable equalizer at block 212. In one embodiment, the method bases the new settings for the variable equalizer on the fact that a 20 degree change in temperature results in a 2 percent change in the level of signals in the cable. On the other hand, if the temperature has not changed by a sufficient amount at block 210, the method avoids adjusting the equalizer and focuses solely on the variable attenuator. At block 214, the method adjusts the control signals for the variable attenuator. For example, the method determines the difference between the monitored level and the expected level of the signals in the signal path. Based on this difference, the method looks for values in a look-up table for control signals for an attenuation level for the variable attenuator to account for the difference. If the temperature has changed, then the method also considers effects of changes to the variable equalizer in selecting new settings for the variable attenuator. The method of FIG. 2 also uses a timer to control storage of the last good settings for the method. At block 216, the method determines whether the timer has expired since the storage of the last good settings. In one embodiment, the timer comprises a five minute timer although a timer of another duration may be used. The duration of the timer is selected to reduce the number of times that data is stored in a programmable read only memory circuit, e.g., an electrically erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM) circuit, used to store the last good settings. If the timer has expired, the settings are stored in block 218 and the method returns to block 204. If the timer has not expired, then the method returns to block 204. If at block 204 the values indicate that the method is to operate in manual mode, the method proceeds to block 220. In manual mode, the control signals fed to the variable equalizer and the variable pad can be directly specified. At block 220, the method determines whether the command for adjusting the equalizer has been entered. If so, the method adjusts the settings for the equalizer at block 222 proceeds to block 224. If not, the method skips block 222 and proceeds directly to block 224. At block 224, the method determines whether a command was received to adjust the variable attenuator. If so, the method adjusts the settings for the variable attenuator at block 226. If not, the method skips block 226 and proceeds directly to block 228 and stores the current settings in memory. At block 228, the method determines whether to exit manual mode. If not, the method returns to block 220. Otherwise, the method exits manual mode and returns to block 206. II. Alternative Embodiment of a Network Amplifier FIG. 3 is a block diagram of one embodiment of a network amplifier indicated generally at 300 and constructed according to the teachings of the present invention. Network amplifier 300 includes a main signal path 302 between PORT 1 and PORT 2. In this embodiment, network amplifier 300 also includes additional ports PORT 3 and PORT 4.

No. 10/034,023, entitled FET Active Load and Current Source by Carl Walter Pobanz, filed on Dec. 28, 2001, owned by the assignee of this application and incorporated herein by reference.     BACKGROUND INFORMATION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to electro-optical devices, and more specifically to modulator drivers for high-speed communications. 2. Description of Related Art In a high-speed fiber optics communication system, the light is often transmitted into the fiber by a continuous-wave laser followed by an electro-optical modulator. The modulator, which turns the light ON and OFF to generate logical ones and zeros for transmission, is generally fabricated with a non-linear material such as Lithium Niobate (LiNbO3) or Indium Phosphide (InP). These materials exhibit a change in optical refractive index or absorption as a function of an applied voltage. Due to the weakness of such electro-optic effects, a substantial voltage is required to maximize the ratio of optical power between on and off states (the extinction ratio) of the modulated light. Moreover, since the modulator operates at or near the full bit-rate of the communications system, the electrical input to the modulator has both the largest magnitude and highest bandwidth of any signal in the system. Producing this signal requires an amplifier, known as a modulator driver, which achieves high output amplitude and high speed without degrading the quality of the transmitted pulse. One popular type of electro-optic modulator is the Mach-Zehnder (MZ) modulator, which uses the linear electro-optic (Pockels) effectcommonly in LiNbO3and an interferometer to generate light pulses. A typical MZ modulator requires a 6-volt peak-to-peak drive applied to a single input (single drive) or applied differentially to, two inputs 180 degrees out of phase (dual drive). In a practical application, the modulator driver should be capable of producing 7 to 8 volts peak-to-peak to obtain adequate margin for variations due to temperature, losses in the materials, drift, etc. Electro-absorption modulators typically require single-ended drive voltages on the order of 3 to 4 volts peak-to-peak. The challenge in modulator driver design is to create an amplifier with high voltage swing, wide bandwidth, and high-fidelity pulse response. For example, in a 40-Gigabit per second (40 Gbps) system the transmitted data signal may contain substantial energy at frequencies up to and beyond 40 GHz, depending on the rise and fall times of the data pulse edges. The modulator driver requires an amplitude response that is nearly constant versus frequency, along with constant group delay (i.e., linear phase response)in other words, all frequencies are amplified equally and travel at the same speed through the amplifier. Deviations from this ideal affect the transmitted data signal, producing pattern-dependent jitter in the timing of the transitions and decreased contrast between logic states (eye closure). One objective in driver-amplifier design is to produce a large amount of current, which typically requires large transistors. The parasitics of the transistorscapacitance, resistance, and in some cases inductance, which increase with the size of the transistorslow down the response, as time is wasted in transferring energy to them rather than to the actual load, the modulator. One classic solution that achieves high speed with a large effective transistor size is the distributed amplifier 100 as shown in FIG. 1, either with a single output or a differential output. This approach defines a certain transistor size that is necessary for the desired output amplitude, and then divides up a large transistor into multiple smaller transistors, which are connected by inductors in such a way that the parasitic capacitance of each small transistor in conjunction with the inductors forms a transmission line. The inductors (or high-impedance transmission line sections) allow the smaller capacitors to charge in sequence, emulating the propagation of a wave in a transmission line, thus obtaining larger bandwidth at the acceptable expense of increased delay. Thus this circuit is also known as a traveling wave amplifier. In recent modulator driver designs for next-generation optical networks that require transmission rates of 40G (OC-768), 50G, and beyond, the distributed amplifier approach has been widely used to achieve the required bandwidth and output amplitude. However, traveling-wave amplifiers occupy a significant amount of die space as the circuits themselves are physically large and make very inefficient use of substrate area. Furthermore, the individual frequency responses of the multiple small transistors produce numerous poles in the amplifier&apos;s transfer function that coincide near the upper bandwidth limit of the amplifier. Beyond this cutoff frequency, the gain decreases sharply and the phase becomes highly nonlinear, creating large variations in group delay as the band edge is approached. Discontinuities and mismatches between devices in the circuit cause unwanted reflections and reactive energy storage in the transmission lines, further degrading the amplitude and phase characteristics as frequency increases. Consequently, in order to mitigate these problems and increase the usable frequency range, designers end up creating a much larger and broader-band amplifier than is necessary, thereby producing an inefficient amplifier structure. Another shortcoming in a conventional design is that it typically requires an external means of biasing, such as a bias tee, which separates DC and AC allowing the power supply and the output signal to coincide on the same line. A bias tee is generally impossible to integrate onto a chip due to the large inductor required to meet the low-frequency requirements of optical data signals (e.g. below 50 kHz). It must be added externally, increasing assembly cost and complicating the packaging of the chip as well as degrading the response of the amplifier. Furthermore, traveling-wave amplifiers produce relatively low gain, typically requiring a pre-driver in order to operate with standard inputs such as 400-millivolt peak-to-peak current-mode logic (CML) signals from multiplexer devices and the like. Increasing the gain is difficult without sacrificing bandwidth, and often means adding another traveling-wave amplifier in series, thus multiplying the shortcomings of the architecture two-fold. Accordingly, there is a need to design an amplifier with a large output voltage and current swing capability, having optimum amplitude and phase characteristics over a broad frequency range for driving modulators in a high-speed fiber optic system. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a modulator driver design that employs a differential amplifier coupled to feedback amplifiers through tuning networks. Each tuning network comprises a set of inductors that enables a broadband response, while reducing the loading effect of the feedback amplifier. An active load is placed at the output to serve multiple purposes: generating a high output voltage swing, reducing the required power supply voltage, and allowing the bias circuits to be integrated on a chip. A modulator driver comprises: a first amplifier stage (A1) having inputs and outputs; a second amplifier stage (A2), having inputs and outputs, the inputs of the second amplifier coupled to the outputs of the first amplifier; an active load having inputs and outputs, the inputs of the active load coupled to the outputs of the amplifier stage; and a feedback stage (A3) having inputs and outputs, the inputs of the feedback stage coupled to the outputs of the second amplifier stage by means of a tuning network, and the outputs of the feedback stage coupled to the inputs of the second amplifier stage. Advantageously, the present invention generates fully differential outputs, which enables operation with dual-drive optical modulators requiring only half the voltage swing, per input, of single-input modulators. The dual-drive capability also improves the performance of the optical system by allowing zero or non-zero adjustable chirp (phase shift) to be added to the optical signal for improved propagation in dispersive fiber.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating a modulator driver 200 for high-speed communications that employs a differential amplifier circuit. The modulator driver 200 comprises a first stage A1220 amplifier, a second stage amplifier or output driver A2240, a feedback stage amplifier A3250a, a feedback stage amplifier A3250b, and an active load 260. An input 210 is feed into the first stage Al 220 amplifier and an output 270 is generated to drive an external circuit or system, such as a modulator. The summing nodes 230a and 230b form a pair of differential feedback, where the summing node 230a is out of phase, but symmetric, with the summing node 230b. A first set of inductors, L1241, L2242, L3243, and L4252 are strategically placed for separating the output driver A2240 and the feedback stage A3250a. A second set of inductors, L5245, L6246, L7247, and L8256 are strategically placed for separating the output driver A2240 and the feedback stage A3250b. These inductors may be realized as lumped circuits such as spirals, or as transmission line sections having relatively high characteristic impedance. A circuit diagram 300 illustrating the block diagram of the modulator driver 200 is shown in FIG. 3. The modulator driver 200 employs a differential pair A2240 with two large transistors Q1310 and Q2311, which connect respectively to active loads 341 and 342 that convert an electrical current that is switched by the transistors into an output voltage 270. To achieve wide bandwidth, strong feedback is provided around the differential pair 310 and 311 that forms the output stage. The feedback circuit is designed with followers Q3320 and Q4321, either source followers with FETs or emitter followers with bipolar transistors. On a first arm of the differential pair A2240, the follower 320 drives a resistor R1251 and the output current of the resistor R1251 is routed back to the input of the differential pair Q1310 in the modulator driver 300, which forms a negative feedback loop, thereby reducing the gain and increasing the bandwidth. On a second arm of the differential pair A2240, the follower 321 drives a resistor R2255 and the output current of the resistor R1255 is routed back to the input of the differential pair Q2311 in the modulator driver 300, which forms a negative feedback loop, thereby reducing the gain and increasing the bandwidth. To achieve wide bandwidth, the amplifier at this point has low input impedance as a result of the feedback current. The parasitic capacitance at the input terminals of the output stage has less of an effect because the preceding amplifier is able to charge the parasitic capacitance relatively fast. The feedback results in a broadband amplifier, but the resulting gain is reduced. In order to increase the gain, the differential pair A1220 operates as a first stage in the modulator driver 200; this first stage acting as a transconductance amplifier that receives a voltage input and generates a current output to directly drive the low-impedance input of the second differential pair A2240. The inductors L1241, L2242, L3243, and L4252 are strategically placed in the modulator 200, which separates the output driver A2240 and the feedback device 250a. In a traditional design that strives for a large output swing, the follower device has to be large to effectively close the strong feedback loop. As a consequence, the follower device loads the output of the composite amplifier, resulting in slow response. In the present invention, the inductors L1241, L2242, and L3243 form a T-coil type of network, and split the cumulative effect of the parasitic capacitances of the output driver A2240, the active load AL1260, and the follower in the feedback stage A3250a, which increases significantly the bandwidth of the modulator driver 200. To compensate for the feedback and attain the desired transfer function of gain versus frequency, an inductor L4252 is added, which connects in series with the output of the follower A3250a. The inductor L4252 affects the response of the feedback network to equalize the feedback gain in the presence of the network formed by the inductors L1241, L2242, and L3243, which in turn increases the bandwidth and generates a desirable feedback response. By selecting the ratios between L1241, L2242, L3243, L4252, the resistance of the feedback resistor R1251 and the size of the follower device Q3230, a designer can manipulate the complex poles and zeros thereby produced in the amplifier&apos;s transfer function and achieve a number of different frequency response characteristics. Therefore, a desirable transfer function can be obtained by selecting the value of the inductors L1241, L2242, L3243, and L4252 to produce optimal pulse characteristics for a particular size of output driver A2240. The inductors L5245, L6246, L7247, and L8256 are strategically placed in the modulator 200, which separates the output driver A2240 and the feedback device 250b. In a traditional design, in order to achieve a large output swing, the follower device has to be fairly large to effectively close the strong feedback loop, which slows down the output. In the present invention, the inductors L5245, L6246, L7247 form a T-coil network, and split the cumulative effect of the parasitic capacitance of the output driver A2240, the active load 260, and the follower in the feedback stage 250b, which increases significantly the bandwidth of the modulator driver 200. To compensate for the feedback and attain the desired transfer function of gain versus frequency, an inductor L8256 is added, which connects in series with the output of the follower A3250b. The inductor L8256 affects the response of the feedback network to equalize the feedback gain in the presence of the network formed by the inductors L5245, L6246 and L7247, which in turn increases the bandwidth and generates a desirable feedback response. By selecting the ratios between L5245, L6246, L7,247, L8256, the resistance of the feedback resistor R2255 and the size of the follower device Q4231, a designer can manipulate the complex poles and zeros thereby produced in the amplifier&apos;s transfer function and achieve a number of different frequency response characteristics. Therefore, a desirable transfer function can be obtained by selecting the value of the inductors L5245, L6246, L7247 and L8256 to produce optimal pulse characteristics for a particular size of output driver A2240. To drive the output 270, the driver stage comprises a composite of amplifiers. In this embodiment, the amplifier A2240 and the feedback amplifier A3250a and 250b drive each other, with a feedback signal going to the summing node 230a between the two amplifiers 240 and 250a, and the summing node 230b between the two amplifiers 240 and 250b. In order to increase the gain-bandwidth of the composite amplifier, the output driver 200 adds the predriver 220, which is implemented with the third amplifier A1220 that precedes the driver stage A2240. The third amplifier A1220 produces an amplified copy of the input signal 210 and delivers it with low output impedance. The low output impedance allows fast charging of parasitic capacitance associated with the driver A2240 and further enhances the bandwidth. The circuit diagram of the modulator driver 300 in FIG. 3 is implemented with field-effect transistors (FETs). The FETs can be fabricated, for example, in InP or GaAs as high electron mobility transistors (HEMT) or pseudomorphic high electron mobility transistors (PHEMT), or in silicon-based processes as complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) FETs. A variety of bipolar transistors may also be used. The transistors Q1310 and Q2311 operate as a differential pair A2240, which forms the second stage of the modulator driver 300. On the first arm of the differential pair A2240, the inductors L1241, L2242, and L3243 form a T-coil type of network, which increases the output bandwidth, and decouples the loading effect of the feedback device Q3320. On the second arm of the differential pair A2240, the inductors L5245, L6246, and L7247, form a T-coil type of network, which increases the output bandwidth, and decouples the loading effect of the feedback device Q4321. The Q3320 transistor operates as a feedback follower device that closes the negative feedback loop from the output back to the input of Q1310. The Q4321 transistor operates as a feedback follower device that closes the negative feedback loop from the output back to the input of Q2311. The inductors L4252 and L8256 equalize the closed-loop gain of the second stage A2240 verses frequency. The first stage A1220 drives the low impedance and high output swing of the second stage A2240. The first stage A1220 comprises the transistor Q5330 and the transistor Q6331, which are transconductance amplifiers that receive voltage inputs and generate current outputs. Inductors L9350 and L10351 create a series peaking function between the two stages to speed up the transient response. The addition of resistors R3355 and R4356 provides a feedback function, which not only speeds up the input to the first stage A1220, but also improves the settling time of the output driver by providing a bleed current to Q3320 and Q4321 feedback devices during operation so that the Q3320 and Q4321 transistors are not completely shut off, and always remain in a fast operating regime. As a result, the modulator driver design 300 produces high output swing and broadband response. Current sources CS1370 and CS2371 supply a constant current to the amplifier stages A1220 and A2240 respectively, and present high impedance at the source nodes to decrease the common mode gain and enable differential operation. A pair of bypass networks BP1360 and BP2361 ensure low power supply impedance for followers 250 in the modulator driver 300. FIGS. 4A-4C are circuit diagrams 410, 420 and 430, illustrating examples of active loads, such as a self-bootstrapped load implemented with depletion-mode FETs. An active load is designed and selected so that the circuit has a significantly higher AC or dynamic resistance than its equivalent DC resistance. A more detailed description of the active loads has been disclosed in a co-pending patent application entitled FET Active Load and Current Source, assigned to the same assignee, and accorded an application number of Ser. No. 10/034,023, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. FIG. 5 is a circuit diagram illustrating a first embodiment of a broadband predriver circuit 510 and the modulator driver 300. The function of the predriver 510 is to produce a desired broadband resistive input impedance, such as 50 ohms or 100 ohms differential, and thereby facilitate a standard interface between the modulator driver and other circuits. Concurrently, the output of the predriver 500 exhibits a low impedance, which drives the modulator driver stage 300 in order to obtain the optimal bandwidth. To achieve broadband low output impedance, the predriver amplifier 510 employs a differential pair, a Q7 transistor 510 and a Q8 transistor 511, with a resistive feedback through R7520 and a resistive feedback R8521 that increase the bandwidth of the amplifier. Resistors R5530 and R6531 are chosen to achieve the desired low output impedance. Inductors L11540 and L12541 enhance the bandwidth by shunt peaking. The predriver 510 can be driven differentially at the input or with a single input, and provides a differential drive for the modulator driver. Therefore, the predriver 510 achieves low output impedance that produces the maximum bandwidth, and creates an unbalanced to balanced signal conversion, which allows the pre-driver 510 to operate with either a differential input or a single input. Resistors R9550 and R10551 provide the proper input DC bias level and also enhance the input impedance. Supply voltages V1561 and V4564 are positive, relative to supply voltage V3563. Supply voltages V1561, V2562, V3563, and V4564 are selected to achieve the most efficient amplifier and keep the minimum power supply voltages as required by the output voltage swing. For example, the supply voltage V1561 is set to &plus;5 volts, the supply voltage V4564 is set to 0 volts, and the supply voltage V2562 and the supply voltage V3563 are set to 5 volts. FIG. 6 is a circuit diagram illustrating a second embodiment of a predriver 600 and the modulator driver 300 that serve the same functions as the predriver 500 in FIG. 5 in producing low output impedance to attain maximum bandwidth. The predriver 600 acts as a buffer. A pair of source followers Q7610 and Q8611 provides a low output impedance drive from the predriver 600 to the modulator driver 300. Diodes D1621, D2622, D3623, and D4624 are level shifting devices to ensure voltages at the output of the predriver 600 match with a common mode voltage or DC required by the modulator driver 300 for operation. Current sources CS1630 and CS3631 provide bias currents for the predriver 600. FIG. 7 is a detailed circuit diagram illustrating the first embodiment of the predriver 500 and the modulator driver 300 as shown in FIG. 5. The current sources are explicitly made out of FETs and resistors. Significantly, transistors Q15710 and Q16711 serve as a variable current source for the predriver 500; this allows the gain of the predriver 500 to be changed, which in turn changes the output amplitude of the driver given a fixed input signal. Because this adjustment is made at the predriver stage, the output stage driver remains operating at the same bias point as before, and therefore its performance is not degraded during the adjustment of the output amplitude. Hence, variable output amplitudes can be achieved while retaining high pulse fidelity. FIG. 8 is a flow diagram illustrating the operational process 800 of the predriver 500 and the modulator 300. At predriver 500, an amplifier Q7510 receives an input voltage 801 from either a single input or from differential inputs, and generates an output voltage with low impedance in step 805. The predriver amplifier Q7510 and Q8511 is also able to convert an unbalanced signal to a balanced signal. At the first driver stage A1 in step 810, the output voltage from the predriver 500 is converted to a current that is applied to the inputs of the second stage A2 by way of the summing node in step 860. At the second stage A2 in step 820, the large transistor Ql 310 amplifies this input signal to produce an output current in the first arm of the differential amplifier A2240. The tuning network, which comprises inductors L1241, L2242, and L3243 separates 830 the feedback stage A3250a from the second stage amplifier A2240, thereby reducing the loading effect of the feedback stage amplifier A3250a. At step 840, the feedback stage amplifier A3250a, which comprises the source follower Q3320, in conjunction with resistor R1251, reduces both the input impedance and gain and increases the bandwidth of the second stage amplifier A2 through negative feedback. The inductor L4252 equalizes 850 the gain, which in turn increases the bandwidth and generates a desirable feedback response. At step 860, the summing node 230a sums the current output from the amplifier A1220 with the feedback current from the feedback stage amplifier A3250a through resistor R1251. At step 870, the active load AL1341 receives the output current from amplifier A2240 and converts it to a final output voltage 880. Similarly, in the second arm of a differential amplifier, at the predriver 500 an amplifier Q7510 and Q8511 receives an input voltage 801 from either a single input or from differential inputs, and generates an output voltage with low impedance in step 806. The predriver amplifier Q7510 and Q8511 is also able to convert an unbalanced signal to a balanced signal. The resulting signal voltages and currents in the second arm of the differential amplifiers are precisely 180 degrees out of phase with those in the first arm. At the first driver stage A1 in step 811, the output voltage from the predriver 500 is converted to a current that is applied to the inputs of the second stage A2 by way of the summing node in step 861. At the second stage A2 in step 821, the large transistor Q2311 amplifies this input signal to produce an output current in the second arm of the differential amplifier A2240. The tuning network, which comprises inductors L5245, L6246, and L7247 separates 831 the feedback stage A3250b from the second stage amplifier A2240, thereby reducing the loading effect of the feedback stage amplifier A3250a. At step 841, the feedback stage amplifier A3250b, which comprises the source follower Q4321, in conjunction with resistor R2255, reduces both the input impedance and gain and increases the bandwidth of the second stage amplifier A2 through negative feedback. The inductor L8256 equalizes 851 the gain, which in turn increases the bandwidth and generates a desirable feedback response. At step 861, the summing node 230b sums the current output from the amplifier A1220 with the feedback current from the feedback stage amplifier A3250b through resistor R2255. At step 871, the active load AL2342 receives the output current from amplifier A2240 and converts the current to a final driver output voltage 881. The above embodiments are only illustrative of the principles of this invention and are not intended to limit the invention to the particular embodiments described.

', '   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This application claims the priority of Korean Patent Application No. 2002-25134, filed May 7, 2002, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to an amplifier, and more particularly, to an AB class buffer amplifier which is capable of reducing power consumption by controlling quiescent current and driving current when operating as a B class amplifier. 2. Description of the Related Art FIG. 1 is a diagram of a driver for driving a liquid crystal of a thin-film transistor-type liquid crystal display. Referring to FIG. 1, to drive a liquid crystal 140, input voltages V1, V2, and V3, having different voltage levels, are applied to the liquid crystal 140 via voltage-follower-type amplifiers 110, 120, and 130. In order to display several colors, the liquid crystal 140 has to be charged, with various voltage levels, or discharged. In other words, a first switch SW1 is turned on to drive the liquid crystal 140 with a first input voltage V1, and if necessary, the first switch SW1 is turned off and a second switch SW2 is turned on to drive the liquid crystal 1410 with a second input voltage V2. Current passing through the liquid crystal 140 must be rapidly sunk or absorbed. Thus, the voltage follower-type amplifiers 110, 120, and 130 used for driving the liquid crystal 140 must be AB class buffer amplifiers. However, it is difficult for conventional AB class buffer amplifiers to control quiescent current since the intensity of the quiescent current is hundreds of thousands of uA. In other words, since integrated circuits included in portable products, such as drivers of liquid crystal displayers, require currents in the range of hundreds of thousands of uA, it is difficult to apply AB class buffer amplifiers to such circuits. FIG. 2 is a diagram of an output port of a conventional A class buffer amplifier to which a comparator is added. Referring to FIG. 2, an output port 200 of a conventional A class buffer amplifier includes a PMOS transistor MP and an NMOS transistor MN1. A signal ODA output from an input node of an amplifier (not shown) is applied to a gate of the PMOS transistor MP. The output port 200 of the A class buffer amplifier further includes a comparator 210 and an NMOS transistor MN2. The NMOS transistor MN2 is connected between an output node ONODE and a ground voltage VSS, and a signal SOUT output from the comparator 210 is applied to the gate of the NMOS transistor. The output port 200 of the A class buffer amplifier shown in FIG. 2 readily controls the quiescent current and turns on the PMOS transistor MP to readily increase the level of the voltage VOUT output from the output node ONODE. However, if the level of the output voltage VOUT is high, current has to flow to the ground voltage VSS in order to lower the level of the output voltage VOUT. Here, it is difficult to rapidly sink the current toward the ground voltage VSS since the NMOS transistor MN1 is turned on for a predetermined period of time by a bias voltage BIAS. Thus, the comparator 210 and the NMOS transistor NM2 are employed to address this problem. If the output voltage VOUT becomes higher than an input voltage VIN, the comparator 210 outputs the signal SOUT at a high level. Then, the NMOS transistor MN2 is turned on and the current path is formed from the output node ONODE toward the ground voltage VSS to allow the current to flow. Thus, the output voltage VOUT may change to a lower level. However, the comparator 210 used in the output node 200 of the A class buffer amplifier has an offset voltage. In other words, the comparator 210 outputs the signal SOUT at a high level only when the level of the output voltage VOUT becomes greater than the level input voltage VIN to a predetermined offset voltage or more. Thus, the minimum voltage level of the output voltage VOUT is determined by the offset voltage and the input voltage VIN. FIG. 3 is a diagram of an output port of a conventional AB class buffer amplifier. Referring to FIG. 3, an output port 300 of a conventional AB class buffer amplifier includes a PMOS transistor MP and an NMOS transistor MN which are connected to each other in series between a power voltage VDD and a ground voltage VSS. A diode-type PMOS transistor M3 is connected between a gate of the PMOS transistor MP and the power voltage VDD, and a diode-type NMOS transistor M4 is connected between a gate of the NMOS transistor MN and the ground voltage VSS. The gate of the PMOS transistor MP and the gate of the NMOS transistor MN are connected to a first current source IB1 and a second current source IB2, respectively. A quiescent current IQ of the output port 300 of the AB class buffer amplifier is controlled by a ratio of the size of the PMOS transistor MP to the size of the diode-type PMOS transistor M3. The quiescent current IQ is also controlled according to the ratio of the size of the NMOS transistor MN to the size of the diode-type NMOS transistor M4. In other words, the quiescent current IQ&equals;bias current IB1*(MP/M3)&equals;bias current IB1*(MN/M4). Accordingly, the quiescent current IQ can be controlled to flow in a small amount by controlling the parameters of the transistors MP, M3, MN, and M4. However, the diode-type transistors M3 and M4 operate as loads of bias transistors M1 and M2. Thus, the diode-type transistors M3 and M4 reduce the gain of the output port 300. As a result, a signal output from the output port 300 of the AB class buffer amplifier does not fully swing. As described above, a signal output from the output port 200 of the A class buffer amplifier shown in FIG. 2 does not fully swing due to the offset voltage, and a signal output from the output port 200 of the AB class buffer amplifier shown in FIG. 3 does not fully swing due to the diode-type transistors that operate as a load. Thus, an AB class buffer amplifier is required to drive an external circuit of an amplifier using a high intensity of current by controlling the quiescent current IQ so that a small amount of the flowing quiescent current IQ is easily sourced or sunk to an output port. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION To address the above-described limitations, it is an object of the present invention to provide an AB class buffer amplifier which is capable of driving an external circuit using a high intensity of current by freely controlling the amount of quiescent current and readily sourcing and sinking the quiescent current to an output port of the AB buffer amplifier.

Like reference numerals in the drawings denote the same members. FIG. 4 is a diagram of an AB class amplifier according to a first embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 4, an AB class buffer amplifier 400 includes a first current controller 410 and a second current controller 420. The first current controller 410 sources current to an output node ONODE in response to a first logic level of a first signal S1, and buffers an input voltage VIN and then outputs it to the output node ONODE in response to a second logic level of the first signal S1. In more detail, the first current controller 410 includes first, second, and third transistors MP1, MP2, and MP3, and a first current source ICS1. A first node of the first transistor MP1 is connected to a power voltage VDD. A first node of the second transistor MP2 is connected to a second node of the first transistor MP1, a gate thereof is connected to the first signal S1, and a second node thereof is connected to a gate of the first transistor MP1. A first node of the third transistor MP3 is connected to the power voltage VDD, a gate thereof is connected to the gate of the second transistor MP2, and a second node thereof is connected to the output node ONODE. The first current source ICS1 is connected between the second node of the second transistor MP2 and a ground voltage VSS and generates a first bias current IB1. The first, second, and third transistors MP1, MP2, and MP3 are PMOS transistors. The first current source ICS1 is connected between the second node of the second transistor MP2 and the ground voltage VSS and may be an NMOS transistor, a gate of which a predetermined first bias voltage is applied to. The second current controller 420 sinks current from the output node ONODE in response to a second logic level of a second signal S2, and buffers the input voltage VIN and then outputs it to the output node ONODE in response to a first logic level of the second signal S2. The first and second signals S1 and S2 are generated at first logic levels if the level of the input voltage VIN is higher than the level of an output voltage VOUT of the output node ONODE, and at second logic levels if the level of the input voltage VIN is lower than the level of the output voltage VOUT of the output node ONODE. The second current controller 420 includes fourth, fifth, and sixth transistors MN4, MN5, and MN6 and a second current source ICS2. A first node of the fourth transistor MN4 is connected to the ground voltage VSS. A first node of the fifth transistor MN5 is connected to a second node of the fourth transistor MN4, the second signal S2 is connected to a gate thereof, and a second node thereof is connected to a gate of the transistor MN4. A first node of the sixth transistor MN6 is connected to the ground voltage VSS, a gate thereof is connected to a gate of the fourth transistor MN4, and a second node thereof is connected to the output node ONODE. The second current source ICS2 is connected between a second node of the fifth transistor MN5 and the power voltage VDD and generates a second bias current IB2. The fourth, fifth, and sixth transistors MN4, MN5, and MN6 are NMOS transistors. The second current source ICS2 is connected between the second node of the fifth transistor MN5 and the power voltage VDD and may be a PMOS transistor, a gate of which receives a predetermined second bias voltage BIAS. The AB class buffer amplifier 400 may further include a comparing unit 430, which compares the input voltage VIN with the output voltage VOUT of the output node ONODE and generates the compared result as the first and second signals S1 and S2. The comparing unit 430 includes first and second comparators 431 and 433. The first comparator 431 receives the input voltage VIN via a positive node and the output voltage VOUT of the output node ONODE via a negative node, compares a level of the input voltage VIN with a level of output voltage VOUT, and generates the first signal S1. The comparator 433 receives the input voltage VIN via a positive node and the output voltage VOUT of the output node ONODE via a negative node, compares a level of the input voltage VIN with a level of the output voltage VOUT, and generates the second signal S2. Hereinafter, the operation of the AB class buffer amplifier according to the first embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to FIG. 4. First, the operation of the AB class buffer amplifier will be described in a case where the level of the output voltage VOUT does not need to be changed and the level of the output voltage VOUT is the same as that of the input voltage VIN. The AB class buffer amplifier 400 operates as a buffer, and in order to reduce the amount of quiescent current IQ, the first and second signals S1 and S2 are saturated in the second and fifth transistors MP2 and MN5, respectively. If the second and fifth transistors MP2 and MP5 are saturated, the first and second current controllers 410 and 420 operate as current mirror-type devices. Thus, the quiescent current IQ is controlled according to the ratios of the transistors MP1 and MP3, and MN4 and MN6, and the first and second bias currents IB1 and IB2 generated by the first and second current sources ICS1 and ICS2. The amount of the quiescent current IQ can therefore be reduced by controlling the sizes of the transistors MP1, MP3, MN4, and MN6. In other words, if a ratio of the size of the first transistor MP1 to the size of the third transistor MP3 and a ratio of the size of the fourth transistor MN to the size of the sixth transistor MN6 are as follows: MP1:MP3&equals;MN4:MN6, quiescent current IQ&equals;First bias current IB1*(MP3/MP1)&equals;Second bias current IB2*(MN6/MN4). Here, it is assumed that the first and second bias currents IB1 and IB2 have the same value. The voltage level of the first signal S1 output from the first comparator 431 is different from the voltage level of the second signal S2 output from the second comparator 433 so as to activate the second and fifth transistors MP2 and MN5 at the same time. The voltage levels of the first and second signals S1 and S2 may saturate the second and fifth transistors MP2 and MN5, respectively. The first and second comparators 431 and 433 are configured as negative feedback types in which the output voltage VOUT is connected to negative nodes of the first and second comparators 431 and 433. Thus, the level of the input voltage VIN may become identical to the level of the output voltage VOUT, and the levels of the first and second signals S1 and S2 may saturate the second and fifth transistors MP2 and MN5, respectively. The first comparator 431 receives the output voltage VOUT fed back via a gate of an NMOS transistor (not shown), and the second comparator 433 receives the output voltage VOUT fed back via a gate of a PMOS transistor (not shown). The construction of the first and second comparators 431 and 433, which output the first and second signals S1 and S2 having different voltage levels so as to saturate the second and fifth transistors MP2 and MN5 at the same time, is apparent to those skilled in the art. Thus, their detailed descriptions will be omitted. The operation of the AB class buffer amplifier will be now described for the case where the levels of the output voltage VOUT of the first and second comparators 431 and 433 need to be lowered, i.e., the level of the output voltage VOUT is higher than the level of the input voltage VIN. If the level of the output voltage VOUT is higher than the level of the input voltage VIN, the first comparator 431 outputs the first signal S1 at the second logic level and the second comparator 433 outputs the second signal S2 at the second logic level. Then, the second transistor MP2 is kept saturated and the fifth transistor MN5 is turned off. Here, the second logic level is close to a low level. In other words, the second level saturates the second transistor MP2 and turns off the fifth transistor MN5. In this case, the first current controller 410 is maintained to operate as a current mirror-type device while the second current controller 420 does not continue to operate as a current mirror-type device, since the fifth transistor MN5 is turned off. The second current source ICS2 applies the second bias current IB2 to gates of the fourth and sixth transistors MN4 and MN6. Then, the fourth and sixth transistors MN4 and MN6 are both saturated. If the second current controller 420 operates as a current mirror-type device, the fourth and sixth transistors MN4 and MN6 are saturated and the amount of the quiescent current IQ is controlled by a ratio of the size of the fourth transistor MN4 to the size of the sixth transistor MN6. Thus, the amount of the quiescent current IQ is reduced with a reduction in the second bias current IB2 of the second current source ICS2. If the second current controller 420 does not operate as a current mirror-type device, the fourth and sixth transistors MN4 and MN6 can pass higher currents since their gate voltages increase more than if the second current controller 420 operates as a current mirror-type device. As the gate voltage of the sixth transistor MN6 increases, a current path is formed from the output node ONODE to the ground voltage VSS. Current is sunk from the output node ONODE to the ground voltage VSS. Then, the level of the output voltage VOUT can be lowered at a high speed. The second current source ICS2 can be replaced by a PMOS transistor this is controlled by a bias voltage. The operation of the AB class buffer amplifier 400 will now be described for the case where the level of the output voltage VOUT does need to be higher, i.e., the level of the output voltage VOUT is lower than a desired level. If the level of the output voltage VOUT is lower than the level of the input voltage VIN, the first comparator 431 outputs the first signal S1 at the first logic level and the second comparator 433 outputs the second signal S1 at the first logic level. Therefore, the second transistor MP2 is turned off and the fifth transistor MN5 is saturated. Here, the first logic level is close to a high level. In other words, the first logic level turns off the second transistor MP2 and saturates the fifth transistor MN. The second current controller 420 is maintained to operate as a current mirror-type device, while the first current controller 410 does not continue to operate as a current mirror-type device since the second transistor MP2 is turned off. The first current source ICS1 allows the first bias current IB1 to continuously flow toward the ground voltage VSS. Thus, voltage levels of gates of the first and third transistors MP1 and MP3 become lower. Then, the first and third transistors MP1 and MP3 become saturated. If the first current controller 410 operates as a current mirror-type device, the first and third transistors MP1 and MP3 are saturated and the amount of the quiescent current IQ is controlled by a ratio of the size of the first transistor MP1 to the size of the third transistor MP3. Thus, the amount of the quiescent current IQ is reduced with a reduction in the first bias current IB1 of the first current source ICS1. If the first current controller 410 does not operate as a current mirror-type device, the first and third transistors MP1 and MP3 can pass higher currents since their gate voltages become lower than if the first current controller 400 operates as a current mirror-type device. Since a gate voltage of the third transistor MP3 drops with a rise in a gate voltage of the sixth transistor MN6 increases, a current path is formed from the power voltage VDD to the output node ONODE. Current flows from the power voltage VDD to the output node ONODE. Then, the level of the output voltage VOUT becomes higher. The first current source ICS1 may be replaced with an NMOS transistor which is controlled by a bias voltage. The AB class buffer amplifier 400 according to the first embodiment of the present invention can drive an external circuit using higher current by freely controlling the amount of the quiescent current IQ and easily sourcing and sinking the current flowing to the output node ONODE. FIG. 5 is a diagram of an AB class amplifier according to a second embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 5, an AB class buffer amplifier 500 according to the second embodiment of the present invention includes a first current controller 510 and a second current controller 520. The first current controller 510 is turned off in response to a first logic level of a first signal S1 and turned on in response to a second logic level of the first signal S1 so as to source currents to an output node ONODE. The first signal S1 is generated at the second logic level if the level of the input voltage VIN is higher than the level of the voltage VOUT output from the output node ONODE, and at the first logic level if the level of the input voltage VIN is lower than the level of the voltage VOUT output from the output node ONODE. In more detail, the first current controller 510 is a first transistor MP1 having a first node connected to a power voltage VDD, a second node connected to the output node ONODE, and a gate connected to the first signal S1. The second current controller 520 sinks current from the output node ONODE in response to a second logic level of a second signal S2, and buffers the input voltage VIN and then outputs it to the output node ONODE in response to a first logic level of the second signal S2. The second signal S2 is generated at the first logic level if the level of the input voltage VIN is higher than the level of the output voltage VOUT from the output node ONODE and as the second logic level if the level of the input voltage VIN is lower than the level of the voltage VOUT output from the output node ONODE. In more detail, the second current controller 520 includes second, third, and fourth transistors MN2, MN3, and MN4, and a bias transistor MPB. A first node of the second transistor MN2 is connected to the ground voltage VSS. A first node of the third transistor MN3 is connected to a second node of the second transistor MN2, a gate thereof is connected to the second signal S2, and a second node thereof is connected to a gate of the second transistor MN2. A first node of the fourth transistor MN4 is connected to the ground voltage VSS, a gate thereof is connected to the gate of the second transistor MN2, and a second node thereof is connected to the output node ONODE. The bias transistor MPB is connected between the second node of the third transistor MN and the power voltage VSS and a predetermined bias voltage BIAS is applied to a gate of the bias transistor MPB. The first and bias transistors MP1 and MPB are PMOS transistors, and the second, third, and fourth transistors MN2, MN3, and MN4 are NMOS transistors. The AB class buffer amplifier 500 may further include a differential amplifier 530 and comparator 540. The differential amplifier 530 receives the input voltage VIN via a negative node and the output voltage VOUT of the output node ONODE via a positive node, compares the input voltage VIN with the output voltage VOUT, and generates the compared result as the first signal S1. The comparator 540 receives the input voltage VIN via a positive node and the output voltage VOUT of the output node ONODE via a negative node, compares the input voltage VIN with the output voltage VOUT, and generates the compared result as the second signal S2. Hereinafter, the operation of the AB class buffer amplifier 500 according to the second embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to FIG. 5. The first current controller 510 is turned off in response to the first logic level of the first signal S1. Here, the first logic level is close to a high level. The first logic level can also saturate the third transistor MN3. This will be described later. The first logic level of the first signal S1 is generated if the level of the input voltage VIN is lower than the level of the output voltage VOUT of the output node ONODE. If the level of the input voltage VIN is lower than the level of the output voltage VOUT of the output node ONODE, the second signal S2 is generated at the second logic level. Here, the second logic level is close to a low level. The second logic level can also saturate the first transistor MP1. Thus, the third transistor MN3 is turned off. The bias voltage BIAS has a level for turning off the bias transistor MPB. In other words, the bias transistor MPB is kept turned on by the bias voltage BIAS. Thus, if the third transistor MN3 is turned off, gage voltages of the second fourth transistors MN2 and MN3 increase. Then, positive current flows to the ground voltage VSS through the output node ONODE and the level of the output voltage VOUT becomes lower. In other words, if the level of the output voltage VOUT needs to be lowered since the level of the output voltage VOUT is high, the AB class buffer amplifier 500 shown in FIG. 5 forms a current path from the output node ONODE toward the ground voltage VSS to lower the level of the output voltage VOUT at a high speed. If the level of the input voltage VIN is higher than the level of the output voltage VOUT of the output node ONODE, the first signal S1 is output as the second logic level and the second signal S2 is output as the first logic level. Then, the first transistor MP1 is saturated and the third transistor MN3 is also saturated. Since the third transistor MN3 is saturated, the second current controller 520 operates a current mirror-type device. The amount of the quiescent current IQ can be controlled by a ratio of the size of second transistor MN2 to the size of the fourth transistor MN4. A current path is formed from the power voltage VDD to the output node ONODE by the saturated first transistor MP1, and current flows to the output node ONODE. Thus, the level of the output voltage VOUT becomes higher. In summary, if the level of the output voltage VOUT is higher than the level of the input voltage VIN, the first signal S1 is output at the first logic level to turn off the first transistor MP1 and the second signal S2 is output at the second logic level to turn off the third transistor MN3. Thus, current is rapidly sunk and the level of the output voltage VOUT becomes lower. In contrast, if the level of the input voltage VIN is lower than the level of the output voltage VOUT, the first signal S1 is output as the second logic level to saturate the first transistor MP1 and the second signal S2 is output as the first logic level to saturate the third transistor MN3. Thus, the second current controller 520 operates as a current mirror-type device, and the amount of the quiescent current IQ is reduced. Also, the current is rapidly sourced by the first transistor MP1 and the level of the output voltage VOUT becomes higher. The AB class buffer amplifier 500 according to the second embodiment of the present invention can rapidly change the level of the output voltage VOUT by easily controlling the amount of the quiescent current IQ using a ratio of the size of the second transistor MN2 to the size of the fourth transistor MN4 and rapidly sourcing and sinking the current. FIG. 6 is a diagram of an AB class amplifier according to a third embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 6, an AB class buffer amplifier 600 includes a first current controller 610 and a second current controller 620. The first current controller 610 is turned on in response to a first logic level of a first signal S1 to sink current from an output node ONODE and turned off in response to a second logic level of the first signal S1. The first signal S1 is generated at the second logic level if a level of an input voltage VIN is higher than a level of a voltage VOUT output from the output node ONODE and at the first logic level if the level of the input voltage VIN is lower than the level of the output voltage VOUT. In more detail, the first current controller 610 is a first transistor MN1 having a first node connected to a ground voltage VSS, a second node connected to the output node ONODE, and a gate to which the first signal S1 is applied. The second current controller 620 sources the current to the output node ONODE in response to the first logic level of the first signal S1, and buffers the input voltage VIN and then outputs it to the output node ONODE in response to the second logic level of the second signal S2. The second signal S2 is generated at the first logic level if the level of the input voltage VIN is higher than the level of the output voltage VOUT of the output node ONODE and at the second level if the level of the input voltage VIN is lower than the level of the output voltage VOUT of the output node ONODE. The current controller 620 includes second, third, and fourth transistors MP2, MP3, and MP4 and a bias transistor MNB. A first node of the second transistor MP2 is connected to the power voltage VDD. A first node of the third transistor MP3 is connected to a second node of the second transistor MP2, a gate thereof is connected to the second signal S2, and a second node thereof is connected to a gate of the second transistor MP2. A first transistor of the fourth transistor MP4 is connected to the power voltage VDD, a gate thereof is connected to a gate of the second transistor MP2, and a second node thereof is connected the output node ONODE. The bias transistor MNB is connected the second node of the third transistor MP3 and the ground voltage VSS and a predetermined bias voltage BIAS is applied to a gate thereof. The first and bias transistors MN1 and MNB are NMOS transistors, and the second, third, and fourth transistors MP2, MP3, and MP4 are PMOS transistors. The AB class amplifier may further include a differential amplifier 630 and a comparator 640. The differential amplifier 630 receives the input voltage VIN via a negative node and the output voltage VOUT of the output node ONODE via a positive node, compares the level of the input voltage VIN with level of the output voltage VOUT, and generates the compared result as the first signal S1. The comparator 640 receives the input voltage VIN via a positive node and the output voltage VOUT of the output node ONODE via a negative node, compares the level of the input voltage VIN with the level of the output voltage VOUT, and generates the compared result as the second signal S2. Hereinafter, the operation of the AB class buffer amplifier 600 according to the third embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to FIG. 6. The first current controller 610 is turned off in response to the second level of the first signal S1. Here, the second logic level is close to a low level. The second logic level can also saturate the third transistor MP3, this will be described later. The second logic level of the first signal S1 is generated if the level of the input voltage VIN is higher than the level of the output voltage VOUT of the output node ONODE. If the level of the input voltage VIN is higher than the level of the output voltage VOUT of the output node ONODE, the second signal S2 is generated at the first logic level. Here, the first logic level is close to a high level. The first level can also saturate the first transistor MN1. Thus, the third transistor MP3 is turned off. The bias voltage BIAS has a level for turning on the bias transistor MNB. In other words, the bias transistor MNB is kept turned on by the bias voltage BIAS. Thus, if the third transistor MP3 is turned off, voltage levels of the gates of the second and fourth transistors MP2 and MP4 become lower. Then, a large amount of current flows from the power voltage VDD to the output node ONODE and the level of the output voltage VOUT becomes higher. In other words, in a case where the level of the output voltage VOUT needs to be higher since the level of the output voltage VOUT is low, the AB class buffer amplifier 600 shown in FIG. 6 forms a current path from the power voltage VDD to the output node ONODE so as to increase the level of the output voltage VOUT at a high speed. If the level of the input voltage VIN is lower than the level of the output voltage VOUT of the output node ONODE, the first signal S1 is output at the first logic level and the second signal S2 is output at the second logic level. Then, the first transistor MN1 is saturated and the third transistor MP3 is also saturated. Since the third transistor MP3 is saturated, the second current controller 620 operates as a current mirror-type device and the amount of the quiescent current IQ is reduced. In other words, the amount of the quiescent current IQ can be controlled by controlling a ratio of the size of the second transistor MP2 to the size of the fourth transistor MP4. By the first transistor MN1, the gate voltage of which is increased, a current path is formed from the output node ONODE to the ground voltage VSS and current flows to the ground voltage VSS. Thus, the level of the output voltage VOUT becomes lower. In summary, if the level of the output voltage VOUT is higher than the level of the input voltage VIN, the first signal S1 is output at the first logic level to saturate the first transistor MN1 and the second signal S2 is output at the second logic level to saturate the third transistor MP3. Thus, the current is rapidly sunk and the level of the output voltage VOUT becomes lower. In contrast, if the level of the output voltage VOUT is lower than the level of the input voltage VIN, the first signal S1 is output at the second logic level to turn off the first transistor MN1 and the second signal S2 is output at the first logic level to turn off the third transistor MP3. Thus, the current is rapidly sourced and the level of the output voltage VOUT becomes higher. As described above, the AB class buffer amplifier 600 according to the third embodiment of the present invention can rapidly change the level of the output voltage VOUT by easily controlling the amount of the quiescent current IQ using the sizes of the transistors MP2 and MP4, and rapidly sourcing and sinking the current.

The first current controller 710 sources current to an output node ONODE in response to a first logic level of a first signal S1, and buffers an input voltage VIN and then outputs it to the output node ONODE in response to a second logic level of the first signal S1. The first signal S1 is generated at the first logic level if a level of the input voltage VIN is higher than a level of a voltage output from the output node ONODE, and at the second logic level if the level of the input voltage VIN is lower than the level of the output voltage of the output node ONODE. In more detail, the first current controller 710 includes first, second, third transistors MP1, MP2, and MP3 and a first current source ICS1. A first node of the first transistor MP1 is connected to a power voltage VDD. A first node of the second transistor MP2 is connected to a second node of the first transistor MP1, a gate thereof is connected to the first signal S1, and a second node thereof is connected to a gate of the first transistor MP1. A first node of the third transistor MP3 is connected to the power voltage VDD, a gate thereof is connected to a gate of the second transistor MP2, and a second node thereof is connected to the output node ONODE. The first current source ICS1 is connected between the second node of the second transistor MP2 and a ground voltage VSS and generates a first bias current IB1. The first, second, and third transistors MP1, MP2, and MP3 are PMOS transistors. The first current source ICS1 may be an NMOS transistor which is connected between the second node of the second transistor MP2 and the ground voltage VSS and a gate of which a predetermined first bias voltage BIAS is applied to. The second current controller 720 buffers the input voltage VIN and outputs it to the output node ONODE in response to the first logic level of the first signal S1 and sinks current from the output node ONODE in response to the second logic level of the first signal S1. The second current controller 720 includes fourth, fifth, and sixth transistors MN4, MN5, and MN6 and a second current source ICS2. A first node of the fourth transistor MN4 is connected to the ground voltage VSS. A first node of the fifth transistor MN5 is connected to a second node of the fourth transistor MN4, a gate thereof is connected to the first signal S1, and a second node thereof is connected to a gate of the fourth transistor MN4. A first node of the sixth transistor MN6 is connected to the ground voltage VSS, a gate thereof is connected to a gate of the fourth transistor MN4, and a second node thereof is connected to the output node ONODE. The second current source ICS2 is connected between a second node of the fifth transistor MN5 and the power voltage VDD and generates a second bias current IB2. The fourth, fifth, and sixth transistors MN4, MN5, and MN6 are NMOS transistors. The second current source ICS2 may be an NMOS transistor which is connected between the second node of the fifth transistor MN5 and the power voltage VDD and a gate of which a predetermined second bias voltage BIAS is applied to. The comparing unit 730 compares the input voltage with the output voltage VOUT of the output node ONODE and generates the compared result as the first signal S1. The comparing unit 730 is comparator which receives the input voltage VIN via a positive node and the output voltage VOUT via a negative node, compares the level of the input voltage VIN with the level of the output voltage VOUT, and generates the compared result as the first signal S1. Hereinafter, the operation of the AB buffer amplifier 700 according to the fourth embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to FIG. 7. The structures of the first and second current controllers 710 and 720 of the AB buffer amplifier 700 are the same as those of the first and second current controllers 410 and 420 of the AB class buffer amplifier 400 according to the first embodiment shown in FIG. 4. Only the structure of the comparing unit 730 is different. In other words, the comparing unit 430 according to the first embodiment uses the first and second comparators 431 and 432. However, the comparing unit 730 according to the fourth embodiment is configured as a single comparator. The comparing unit 730 outputs the first signal S1 at the second logic level if the level of the output voltage VOUT is higher the level of the input voltage VIN. The second logic level saturates the second transistor MP2 and turns off the fifth transistor MN5. If the second transistor MP2 is saturated, the first current controller 710 operates as a current mirror-type device so as to control the amount of the quiescent current IQ by a ratio of the size of the first transistor MP1 to the size of the third transistor MP3. If the fifth transistor MN5 is turned off, gate voltages of the fourth and sixth transistors MN4 and MN6 of the second current controller 720 rise and a current path is formed form the output node ONODE to the ground voltage VSS. Thus, the current can rapidly be sunk and the level of the output voltage VOUT becomes lower. In contrast, the comparing unit 730 outputs the first signal S1 at the first logic level if the level of the output voltage VOUT is lower than the level of the input voltage VIN. The first logic level can turn off the second transistor MP2 and saturate the fifth transistor MN5. If the fifth transistor MN5 is saturated, the second current controller 720 operates as a current mirror-type device so as to control the amount of the quiescent current IQ according to the ratio of the size of the fourth transistor MN4 to the size of the sixth transistor MN6. If the second transistor MP2 is turned off, gate voltages of the first and third transistors MP1 and MP3 of the first current controller 710 become lower and a current path is formed from the power voltage VDD to the output node ONODE. Thus, rapid sourcing of the current is possible and the level of the output voltage VOUT becomes higher. The level of the output voltage VOUT becomes equal to the level of the input voltage VIN if the AB class buffer amplifier 700 operates as a buffer. Here, the comparing unit 730 generates the first signal S1 at a level for saturating both the second and fifth transistors MP2 and MN5 in order to reduce the amount of the quiescent current IQ. The comparing unit 730, which outputs the first signal S1 having a voltage level for saturating both the second and fifth transistors MP2 and MN5 in order to reduce the amount of the quiescent current IQ, may be realized by one of ordinary skill in the art, and thus detailed description thereof will be omitted. The AB class buffer amplifier 700 according to the fourth embodiment of the present invention is the same as the AB buffer amplifier 400 according to the first embodiment except for the structure of the comparing unit 730. Thus, detailed description of the operation of the fourth embodiment will be omitted.

', '   BACKGROUND The present invention is directed towards the technology of signal transmission, and, specifically towards electronic circuits for power amplification. Mobile communication devices, for example cellular telephones, need to transmit radio frequency (RF) signals at prescribed power levels. The prescribed power levels are dictated by the radio protocol standard under which the mobile device is operating. For example, in a GSM (Global System for Mobile communication) network, a mobile device transmits RF signals to base stations over a wide dynamic range, for example, up to 35 dBm, depending on the strength of the transmitted signal that the base station is receiving. When transmission is initiated, the mobile device needs to reach the prescribed power level quickly, typically within about 30 microseconds. Further, the power level of the RF output signal must be maintained at the prescribed constant level. To achieve the transmission power level, mobile devices include power amplifiers to amplify internally generated RF signals (RF input signal, or RF_IN) to RF transmission signals (RF output signal, or RF_OUT) having the prescribed power level. To maintain the power level of the RF output signal constant, a feedback control loop circuit is often used. FIG. 1 (prior art) illustrates a simplified diagram of an RF amplifier circuit 20 having a known design. Here, a power amplifier 22 amplifies the RF input signal 21 and generates the RF output signal 23. To hold the power of the RF output signal 23 constant, a feedback control loop 25 is used. In feedback control loop 25, a resistor 24 connected to the power amplifier 22 is used to sample the current drawn by the power amplifier 22 by detecting the voltage drop across the resistor 24. The voltage drop is amplified and the amplified voltage is compared with a reference voltage, VREF. The reference voltage can be at the prescribed power level. The difference between the amplified voltage and the VREF is an automatic power control input voltage VAPC. The VAPC is then applied to the power amplifier 22. This negative feedback loop 25 causes the power amplifier 22 to draw a supply current that is proportional to the VREF. The power of the output signal 23 of the power amplifier 22 is proportional to the supply current. The supply current is drawn from a battery illustrated as the battery voltage VBAT in FIG. 1. In this design, the amplifier circuit 20 has the disadvantage that the voltage drop across the resistor 24 reduces the voltage available to the power amplifier 22, thus lowering the power added efficiency of the amplifier circuit 20. In addition, the resistor 24 is a small low-tolerance resistor that can handle a high current. Such resistors tend to be expensive. FIG. 2 (prior art) illustrates a simplified diagram of an RF amplifier circuit 30 again having a known design. Here, a power amplifier 32 amplifies the RF input signal 21 and generates an output signal 31 that is operated on by a feedback control circuit 35 before being directed to RF output node 33. In the feedback control circuit 35, a directional coupler 34 directs most of the output signal 31 to the RF output node 33, but a portion (coupled signal) of the output signal 31 is directed to a detector 36. The detector 36 detects the peak voltage amplitude of the coupled signal and sends the detected voltage to an error amplifier 38. The detector 36 generally contains a detector diode and a reference diode. The error amplifier 38 compares the detected voltage, VDETECTED, to the VREF and generates an amplified automatic power control signal, VAPC, having a voltage proportional to the difference between VDETECTED and VREF. The output of the error amplifier 38 is applied to the power amplifier 32. In this design, the amplifier circuit 30 has the disadvantage that the coupler 34 reduces the through output power of the amplified output RF signal 31. The coupled output power is also reduced. Depending on the implementation, the reduction in through output power by the coupler 34 can be significant, thus decreasing the power added efficiency of the amplifier circuit 30. Further, the amplifier circuit 30 can be sensitive to temperature in its ability to operate properly. The correlation between the power of the output signal 31 and the VDETECTED can change with temperature variations. This is because, in a typical layout, the components of the amplifier circuit 30 are discrete components and that the components are not sufficiently proximal to each other within the amplifier circuit 20. In fact, components such as the coupler 34 are surface mount (SMT) components that take a relatively large area. Finally, the dynamic range of amplifier circuit 30 is limited. This is because the coupled signal is 10 to 13 dB lower than the output signal 31. As the power of the output signal 31 decreases, the voltage of the coupled signal can become insufficient to turn on the detector 36. Accordingly, there remains a need for an improved power amplifier circuit. SUMMARY These needs are met by the present invention. According to one aspect of the present invention, an amplifier circuit includes an amplifier amplifying an input voltage signal to generate an amplified voltage signal and a peak-to-peak detector connected to the amplifier detecting peak-to-peak voltage of the amplified signal to generate a detected signal. A comparator, connected to the amplifier and the peak-to-peak detector, compares the detected signal to a reference voltage signal, generating an automatic power control signal for controlling the amplifier. According to another aspect of the present invention, an integrated circuit includes a negative peak detector receiving an input voltage signal and generating a first intermediate signal and a positive peak detector. The positive peak detector receives the first intermediate signal and generates a detected signal, the detected signal having value of peak-to-peak voltage of the input signal. The detected signal is substantially a direct current (DC) voltage. According to yet another aspect of the present invention, a method of amplifying a signal is disclosed. First, an input RF signal is amplified, using an amplifier, to generate an amplified signal. Next, the peak-to-peak voltage of the amplified signal is detected using a peak-to-peak detector. The detected voltage is compared with a reference voltage to produce an automatic power control input signal. Finally, the automatic power control input signal is applied to the amplifier to control the degree of amplification. Other embodiments and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description, taken in combination with the accompanying drawings, illustrating by way of example the principles of the invention.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present invention, in one embodiment, is an amplifier circuit that includes an amplifier for amplifying an input signal to generate an amplified signal. A peak-to-peak detector detects the peak-to-peak voltage of the amplified signal to generate a detected signal. A comparator compares the detected signal to a reference signal to generate an automatic power control signal for controlling said amplifier. The amplifier circuit achieves and maintains a prescribed power level over a wide range of power, fabrication processes and temperature. The peak-to-peak detector is integrated into the amplifier circuit and includes transistors whose threshold voltages change in unison with varying temperatures and fabrication processes. An added benefit of integrating the peak-to-peak detector into the amplifier circuit is the reduced power consumption and size of the amplification circuit. FIG. 3 is a simplified block diagram of a power amplifier circuit 100 (also referred to as the circuit 100) according to one embodiment of the present invention. The amplifier circuit 100 can be a part of a mobile handset. The amplifier circuit 100 includes a power amplifier 106 to amplify an RF input signal 101, RF_IN, to produce an amplified signal at node 112. In one embodiment, the RF input signal 101 and the amplified signal 112 both have frequencies above 400 MHz. Various nodes of the circuit 100 are designated using reference numbers in FIG. 3 and in subsequent Figures. For convenience, the same reference number is used to designate a node as well as the signal present at the node. An output matching network 104 is used to step-up the voltage of the amplified signal 112 and is further discussed below in reference to FIG. 6. A peak-to-peak detector 108 (also referred to as the detector 108) and a comparator 130 combine to operate as a power control loop to maintain a desired level of power in the RF output signal 109. In the illustrated embodiment, the peak-to-peak detector 108 is connected to the amplifier 106 via the node 112. The detector 108 detects a peak-to-peak voltage level of the amplified signal 112 and generates a detected signal voltage, VDETECTED, present at node 113. The VDETECTED 113 is sent to the comparator 130. The comparator 130 compares the VDETECTED 113 to a reference voltage 103, VREF, to generate an automatic power control input signal 105, VAPC. The VAPC is a voltage signal proportional to the difference between the VDETECTED 113 and the VREF 103. The VAPC 105 is applied to the power amplifier 106 to control the degree of amplification of the input RF signal 101 to maintain a desired level of power in the amplified signal 112, thus maintaining a prescribed level of power in the RF output signal 109. In the power control loop (including the detector 106 and the comparator 108), the reference voltage (VREF) 103 can be calibrated such that the circuit 100 generates the RF output signal 109 having power levels prescribed by the mobile device manufacturer. The VREF 103 can be set to correspond to a wide range of power levels, for example, from zero power to 35 dBm. During GSM signal transmission for example, which uses a time division multiple access (TDMA) protocol, the power amplifier circuit 100 is operated through its entire range of power at every time slot. A time slot for GSM occurs every 577 microseconds, and the signal power is ramped up during the first 30 microseconds of the time slot. By accurately ramping up to the desired power level within a maximum and minimum ramp-up speed, spectral spreading from transmitting information above the data rate can be reduced. The power amplifier 106 is then turned off after each time slot. Continuing to refer to FIG. 3, a single integrated circuit chip 102 can include the power amplifier 106, the detector 108, and even the comparator 103. The integrated circuit 102 can be a monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC). In the illustrated embodiment, the power amplifier 106 includes a series of three cascaded amplifiers. In other embodiments, however, the power amplifier can include one or a plurality of amplifiers. Further, in an alternative embodiment, the comparator 130 is integrated into the detector 108. Here, for simplicity, the detector 108 and the comparator 130 are treated as separate portions of the integrated circuit 102. In the power amplifier circuit 100, the power control loop is formed without a coupler as illustrated in FIG. 2. The design of the power amplifier circuit 100 reduces the number of components compared to that of the amplifier circuit 30 of FIG. 2 and thereby reduces the relative cost and size of the circuit 100. At today&apos;s prices, each coupler can cost about 30 cents. Further, an SMT (surface mount technology) directional coupler alone can be 0.5 square millimeters large whereas an entire amplifier circuit 100 on a chip can have an area of about only twice that size. Thus, eliminating the coupler, as well as the associated detector and bias circuitry, can reduce the size of the amplifier circuit several times. Moreover, the amplified RF signal 112 in power amplifier circuit 100 does not lose power by traveling through a coupler on its way from the power amplifier 106 to peak-to-peak detector 108. This design saves battery power and prolongs battery life. In addition, because no power is lost on the coupled output, the peak-to-peak voltage amplitude of signals having less power at specified impedance can be detected. FIG. 4 illustrates one embodiment of the peak-to-peak detector 108 of FIG. 3 in a greater detail. Again, various nodes of the circuit 100 are designated using reference numbers. For convenience, the same reference number is used to designate a node as well as the signal present at the node. The detector 108 includes a negative peak detector 126 and a positive peak detector 128. The negative peak detector 126 receives the amplified voltage signal 112 and generates a first intermediate voltage signal, present at node 150. The positive peak detector operates on the first intermediate signal 150 and generates a second intermediate signal at node 113. The second intermediate signal 113 is also refereed to as the detected signal voltage, VDETECTED 113. The peak-to-peak detector 108 converts the peak-to-peak voltage amplitude of the amplified RF signal 112 present on node 112 to a second intermediate signal 113 having a second direct current voltage component that is proportional to the peak-to-peak voltage amplitude of the amplified RF signal 112. Electrical values of the various components of the circuit 100 can vary widely depending on the implementation, RF frequency, and process technology used. The values discussed in this document only suggest the values of a sample embodiment and does not limit the scope of the present invention. Negative Peak Detector Referring to FIG. 4, the negative peak detector 126 includes a blocking capacitor 140, a first FET (field effect transistor) 152, a stabilizing capacitor 162, a first resistor 164, and a temperature and process compensating reference voltage generator 132. The temperature and process compensating reference voltage generator 132, in turn, includes a second FET 156 and a third FET 158 along with a second resistor 166. In one embodiment, the blocking capacitor 140 and the stabilizing capacitor 162 have capacitance in the order of pico-farads and can be, for example, ten pico-farad each. The first resistor 164 has resistance in the order of hundreds of ohms and can be, for example, 500 ohms. The second resistor 166 has resistance in the order of thousands of ohms and can be, for example, 2,000 ohms. Positive Peak Detector The positive peak detector 128 includes a fourth FET 154 and a ripple filter 134. The ripple filter has a third capacitor 136 and a third resistor 138 connected to the third capacitor 136. Each of the transistors illustrated in FIG. 4 has a source, a drain, and a gate portion as illustrated in the Legend of FIG. 4. In one embodiment, the third capacitor 136 has capacitance in the order of hundreds of pico-farads and can be, for example, 500 pico-farad. The third resistor 138 has resistance in the order of thousands of ohms and can be, for example, 2,000 ohms. Representative Waveforms FIG. 5 is a graph illustrating ideal representative waveforms at various nodes of the amplifier circuit 100 of FIGS. 3 and 4. FIG. 5 illustrates these waveforms at two different power levels (or voltage amplitudes)the first power level between zero and 16 nanoseconds, and a second power level at between 16 to 32 nanoseconds. Shown are the amplified signal 112, first intermediate signal 150, and second intermediate signal 113 which is also referred to as the detected signal voltage 113. Also illustrated are the following: a peak-to-peak voltage amplitude 212 and a direct current voltage component 214 of the amplified RF signal 112; a peak-to-peak voltage amplitude 250 and a first direct current voltage component 252 of the first intermediate signal 150; and a second direct current voltage component 213 of the second intermediate signal 113. For simplicity, these values are illustrated only for the portions of the signals 112, 150, and 113 within the first power level between zero to 16 nanoseconds. The peak-to-peak voltage amplitude of the second intermediate signal 113 is small and results from the voltage discharge produced by a ripple filter 134 as discussed below. Operations of the Peak to Peak Detector Operations of the detector 108 of FIG. 4 and its various components are discussed with references to the representative voltage signal waveforms illustrated by FIG. 5. Referring to FIGS. 4 and 5, the amplified signal 112 from the power amplifier 106 of FIG. 3 enters the detector 108, and more specifically the negative peak detector 126, through a blocking capacitor 140. As the amplified RF signal 112 passes through the blocking capacitor 140, its direct current voltage component is removed. In another embodiment, excessive RF current is limited from reaching FET 152 and FET 154 by a series resistor (not shown in the Figures) in series with capacitor 140. As the amplified signal 112 is received by the blocking capacitor 140, on a negative peak swing, the source of FET 152 provides the current that charges the blocking capacitor 140. A battery VBAT is coupled to the drain of FET 152 and is the ultimate current source. When the amplified RF signal 112 swings to a positive peak, the first FET 152 turns off, and the charge on the blocking capacitor 140 is dumped through a fourth FET 154 (of the positive peak detector 128) to the third capacitor 136 and is detected at node 113. Then the charge is dissipated by the third resistor 138 in relation to the time constant of the third capacitor 136 and the third resistor 138. The negative peak detector 126 imparts a first direct current voltage component 252 to the first intermediate signal 150 after blocking capacitor 140 removes the direct current voltage component from the amplified RF signal 112. The negative peak detector 126 includes a temperature and process compensating reference voltage generator 132 that, together with the FETs 152 and 154, keeps the voltage at node 113 substantially at zero volts when the voltage of the amplified RF signal 112 is zero volts, regardless of temperature and process variations. This is because all of the FETs 152, 154, 156 and 158 are fabricated within the same integrated circuit 102 of FIG. 3, thus experience the same environmental conditions. At node 150, the amplified RF signal 112 has been transformed into a first intermediate signal 150 having a first peak-to-peak voltage amplitude 250 proportional to the peak-to-peak voltage amplitude 212 of the amplified RF signal 112. Moreover, the first intermediate signal 150 has a first direct current voltage component 252 that, for a sinusoidal waveform, is substantially equal to one half of the first peak-to-peak voltage amplitude 250. For non-sinusoidal time domain waveforms of the first intermediate signal 150, the first direct current voltage component 252 is approximately equal to the integral of the time domain voltage signal waveform of the first intermediate signal 150 throughout a time period divided by that time period. The first intermediate signal 150 is present between the source of the first FET 152 and the gate of the fourth FET 154, which is a part of the positive peak detector discussed in more detail below. The FETs 154, 156, and 158 are diode-connected transistors, whereas the first FET 152 (also referred to as the biased FET 152) is biased by a voltage applied to its gate that is present throughout node 160. Each of the FETs 152, 154, 156, and 158 has an identical threshold voltage (VTH). The threshold voltage is illustrated as 205 in FIG. 5. The voltage present at node 160 is stabilized by the stabilizing capacitor 162 as the sum of the threshold voltages of the second FET 156 and the third FET 158these threshold voltages are referred to as VTH&lsqb;156&rsqb; and VTH&lsqb;158&rsqb;, respectively. The second resistor 166 draws current from a voltage source, typically a battery and illustrated as VBAT, and biases up the two diode-connected transistors FET 156 and FET 158, thereby establishing the VTH&lsqb;156&rsqb; and the VTH&lsqb;158&rsqb; as direct current voltages. The voltage present at the node 168 equals the VTH&lsqb;156&rsqb;. A small current is drawn by the first FET 152 through the first resistor 164, which biases the first FET 152 into a linear region of operation. As the first FET 152 draws current when the voltage present at node 160 exceeds the voltage present at node 150 by more than the threshold voltage of the first FET 152, VTH&lsqb;152&rsqb;, the minimum voltage present at node 150 is maintained at a voltage equal to VTH&lsqb;156&rsqb; plus VTH&lsqb;158&rsqb; minus VTH&lsqb;152&rsqb;. These three threshold voltagesVTH&lsqb;156&rsqb;, VTH&lsqb;158&rsqb;, and VTH&lsqb;152&rsqb;are equal because the FETS 152, 154, 156, and 158 are the same type of transistor. Accordingly, the minimum voltage at node 150 is one threshold voltage 205. The blocking capacitor 140, in conjunction with the biased FET 152, the diode-connected FETs 156 and 158, and the stabilizing capacitor 162, operate to place the negative peaks of the first intermediate signal 150 at the minimum voltage at node 150, which equals one threshold voltage. Accordingly, the first intermediate signal 150 present at node 150 has a first direct current voltage component 252 that is substantially equal to the integral of the time domain voltage signal waveform of the first intermediate signal 150 throughout a time period divided by that time period, plus the relatively small threshold voltage VTH&lsqb;152&rsqb;. For sinusoidal waveforms of the first intermediate signal 150, the first direct current voltage component 252 is substantially equal to one half of the first peak-to-peak voltage amplitude 250 plus the threshold voltage VTH&lsqb;152&rsqb;. At the node 113, the first intermediate signal 150 has been transformed into a second intermediate signal 113 having a second direct current voltage 213 component with voltage proportional to the peak-to-peak voltage amplitude 250 of the first intermediate signal 150. The third capacitor 136 and the third resistor 138 form a ripple filter 134 that, together with the diode-connected fourth transistor 154, produce a waveform having a ripple at the positive peaks of the second intermediate signal 113. These components form the positive peak detector 128. In the positive peak detector 128, the fourth FET 154 is biased with a small standing current through the third resistor 138. As the fourth FET 154 draws current when the voltage present at node 150 exceeds the voltage present at node 113 by more than the threshold voltage of FET 154, VTH&lsqb;154&rsqb;, the minimum voltage present at node 113 is maintained at a voltage approximately equal to the ground voltage at node 146. The voltage present between the source of the fourth FET 154 and the node 113 is VTH&lsqb;156&rsqb;&plus;VTH&lsqb;158&rsqb;VTH&lsqb;152&rsqb;VTH&lsqb;154&rsqb; which is approximately zero, or the ground 146 potential. This is because, as already discussed, these transistors are the same type of transistor and have the same threshold values. Despite temperature and process variations, the second direct current voltage 213 component present at node 113 remains at a voltage that is established in relation to the ground voltage 142. If the amplified RF signal 112 were to have a zero value (not illustrated), the corresponding second direct current voltage component equals the ground voltage 142, which is typically zero. The ground voltage is defined as zero within the circuit 100. The second direct current voltage component 213 for a zero amplitude input signal (not illustrated) does not vary from the ground voltage even when the threshold voltage, VTH, of the transistors changes with temperature and process variations because each VTH changes by the same amount. Two threshold voltages (VTH&lsqb;156&rsqb;&plus;VTH&lsqb;158&rsqb;) minus two threshold voltages (VTH&lsqb;152&rsqb;&plus;VTH&lsqb;154&rsqb;) continues to yield approximately zero volts. Therefore, the performance of peak-to-peak detector 108 is largely process and temperature independent. The second direct current voltage 213 component of the second intermediate signal 113 is not only proportional to, but is also nearly equal to, the peak-to-peak voltage amplitude 250 of the first intermediate signal 150. A small remaining difference between the second direct current voltage 213 component and the peak-to-peak voltage amplitude 250 of the first intermediate signal 150 depends on the time constant of the ripple filter 134. The minimum voltage at node 113 has dropped by one threshold voltage in relation to the minimum voltage at node 150, thereby removing the threshold voltage VTH&lsqb;152&rsqb; from the first direct current voltage 252 component and placing the second direct current voltage 213 component near the peak voltage of each peak of the first intermediate signal 150. The second direct current voltage component 213 is the detected voltage (VDETECTED) 113 and approximates the peak-to-peak voltage of the first intermediate signal 150, which in turn is proportional to the peak-to-peak voltage of the amplified RF signal 112. The VDETECTED is present at node 113. As already described, the VDETECTED 113 is compared with the VREF 103 by the comparator 103 of FIG. 3. The comparator generates the automatic power control input signal 105, VAPC. The VAPC for the illustrated waveform is illustrated as graph 105. Implementations As discussed, in an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the detector 108 can also include a comparator such as the comparator 130 of FIG. 3 as part of the detector 108. In one embodiment, the detector 108 is implemented in an enhancement-mode pseudomorphic high-electron-mobility (ePHEMT) FET process. The ePHEMT FET process allows for a sensitivity sufficient to detect peak-to-peak voltage swings of amplified RF signals 112 whose voltages have not yet been augmented by the output matching network 104 of FIG. 3. Agilent Technology, Inc.&apos;s ATF-551 Low Noise Enhancement Mode Pseudomorphic HEMT can be used in the detector 108. Other embodiments of a peak-to-peak detector can be implemented with other types of transistors, such as MOSFETs (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor), CMOS FETs, Silicon Bipolar Transistors, and HBTs (Heterojunction Bipolar Transistors). Alternative implementations of the detector 108 remain temperature and process compensated so long as the transistors at the locations 152, 154, 156 and 158 are replaced by other transistors all of the same type. A peak-to-peak detector can also be implemented using diodes, such as Schottky diodes, in place of the transistors 154, 156, and 158. The transistor 152 needs to remain a component that can be biased, such as some type of transistor. A peak-to-peak detector implemented using diodes in place of the ePHEMT FETs would be partially temperature and process compensated. Output Matching Network FIG. 6 illustrates one embodiment of the output matching network 104 of FIG. 3 in more detail and portions of the power amplification circuit 100 of FIG. 3. The output matching network 104 is an impedance transformer that uses LC circuits including bias inductor 230 to transform high current low voltage signals to lower current and higher voltage signals to step up the voltage. In FIGS. 3 and 4, the detector 108 is illustrated as connecting to the node 112 for accessing the amplified signal at 112 from the power amplifier 106 at node 112. In FIG. 6, nodes 112a and 112b are illustrated as alternative connection points for the detector 108 to access a partially stepped-up amplified signal at 112a or a fully stepped-up amplified signal at 112b. Present at the node at 112b is the same signal as the RF output signal 109. A bond pad 234 can be used to make the connection to the node 112b. The alternative connections from the nodes 112a and 112b to the detector 108 as well as the connection from the node 112 to the detector are illustrated using dashed lines. If the detector 108 is connected to the node 112, the connection lies entirely within the integrated circuit chip 102. With the connection to the node 112, the detector 108 can generate as output a second intermediate signal whose second direct current voltage component is proportional to a peak-to-peak voltage amplitude of an amplified RF signal of only about 0.355 V. For a load impedance of 50 Ohms, an RF signal with a 0.355 V peak-to-peak voltage amplitude has a power of about 5 dBm. Detecting the voltage of a coupled signal in the prior art that has lost between 10 and 13 dB in its coupled output power from the 5 dBm amplified RF signal would yield less accurate results because the peak-to-peak voltage available for detection would be only about 0.112 V, assuming the same load impedance of 50 Ohms. Alternatively, the sensitivity of the detector 108 is increased if the detector 108 is connected to one of the alternative connections at nodes 112a or 112b. This can be useful when the desired output power of the RF output signal 109 is relatively low. The partially stepped-up amplified signal at the node 112a has a higher voltage than the amplified signal at the node 112 but lower current. The fully stepped-up amplified signal at the node 112b has even a higher voltage than the amplified signal at the node 112 but even less current. Sample GSM Waveforms FIG. 7 shows representative voltage signal waveforms on various nodes of peak-to-peak detector 108 that are modeled to conform to a sample GSM radio protocol. The waveforms illustrated in FIG. 7 are similar or analogous to the waveforms of FIG. 5. For convenience, waveforms in FIG. 7 that are similar to corresponding waveforms in FIG. 6 are assigned the same reference numerals accompanied by letter c. FIG. 7 illustrates amplified radio frequency signal 115c, first intermediate signal 150c, second intermediate signal 113c, and comparator output signal 105c. The amplified RF signal 112c is shown having both a large voltage amplitude (between zero and two nanoseconds) and a small voltage amplitude (between 2.0 nanoseconds and 4.5 nanoseconds). Note that even for an amplified GSM radio signal 112c with a large peak-to-peak voltage of about 4 volts, as illustrated, the ripple voltage amplitude of the second intermediate signal 113 is relatively small and barely noticeable in FIG. 10. The invention sees application in fields other than mobile communications.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to a PLL circuit for eliminating self-jitter in a signal which is received by a control circuit, in particular the self-jitter in a signal which is emitted by a clock and data recovery circuit (CDR) within a receiver. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION FIG. 1 shows an ADPLL circuit (ADPLL: All Digital Phase Locked Loop) according to the prior art. PLL circuits may be either analog or digital. PLL circuits are phase locked loops and are used for synchronizing the frequency and phase of two oscillations. In this case, PLL circuits essentially comprise a phase comparison circuit for producing a phase difference signal and which determines the phase difference between a received signal and a fed-back output signal from the PLL circuit, a downstream loop filter for filtering the phase difference signal that is produced, and an oscillator which is controlled by the filtered phase difference and generates the output signal from the PLL circuit. FIG. 2a shows a digital loop filter according to the prior art (P-regulator), which is used within a conventional ADPLL circuit, as is illustrated in FIG. 1. FIG. 2b shows the associated transmission characteristic of the conventional digital loop filter (P-regulator) as illustrated in FIG. 2a.  PLL circuits are circuits in which a frequency is synchronized by means of a reference frequency until the output signal and the reference signal match in frequency and phase. The received signal is generally a reference clock signal. If the reference clock signal is obtained by means of a clock and data recovery circuit CDR (Clock Data Recovery) within a receiver, the received signal is subject to jitter which is formed from the self-jitter of the clock and data recovery circuit CDR and from data jitter. A conventional PLL circuit having the loop jitter illustrated in FIG. 2 is used for stabilizing the applied reference clock signal. A conventional PLL circuit, as is illustrated in FIG. 1, acts like a low-pass filter in which high-frequency signal components are filtered out and low-frequency signal components of the applied reference clock signal are passed on. In consequence, the PLL circuit suppresses high-frequency signal interference, but the reference clock signal may diverge slowly if the frequency of the reference clock signal changes. The conventional PLL circuit according to the prior art, as is illustrated in FIG. 1, contains a linear P-regulator and a linear loop filter, as is shown in FIG. 2a. The linear transfer function of the digital loop filter, as is shown in FIG. 2b, means that the signal components of the self-jitter of the received signal are amplified in accordance with the gain factor k setting, as is illustrated in FIG. 6a. The self-jitter which is produced by the clock and data recovery circuit CDR is amplified in accordance with the gain factor k setting of the digital loop filter. The higher the gain factor k setting, the higher is the gain of the self-jitter signal component as well. If the gain factor k of the linear P-regulator, as is illustrated in FIG. 2a, is set to be small, although this reduces the gain of the self-jitter in the same way, the ADPLL circuit will no longer be able to follow the reference clock signal that is emitted by the clock and data recovery circuit CDR if the gain factor k setting is too low. In this case, the frequency of the clock signal which is stabilized by the PLL circuit drifts away from the frequency of the received data signal, and data losses can occur when transferring the received data to a data register which is clocked by the stabilized clock signal. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The object of the present invention is therefore to provide a PLL circuit which is able to completely eliminate the self-jitter in a signal which is received by a control circuit, and which can follow a frequency change in the received signal. The invention provides a PLL circuit for eliminating self-jitter in a signal which is received by a control circuit, having a phase comparison circuit for producing a phase difference signal, which indicates the phase difference between the received signal and a fed-back output signal from the PLL circuit, a loop filter for filtering the phase difference signal which is produced, an oscillator, which is controlled by the filtered phase difference signal, for producing the output signal from the PLL circuit, with the loop filter having a nonlinear transfer function. In one preferred embodiment of the PLL circuit, the transfer function is point-symmetrical about the zero point. This offers the advantage that the self-jitter, which likewise occurs symmetrically with respect to the zero point, is eliminated completely in both phase difference amplitude directions. In one particularly preferred embodiment of the PLL circuit according to the invention, the nonlinear transfer function of the loop filter has three transmission ranges with the loop filter in a first transmission range having a signal gain of zero for a small phase difference up to a first threshold value, with the loop filter having a nonlinear signal gain in a second transmission range for a medium phase difference between the first threshold value and a second threshold value, and with the loop filter having a constant maximum signal amplitude in a third transmission range for a large phase difference, which is greater than the second threshold value. The loop filter is preferably digital. In one particularly preferred embodiment of the PLL circuit according to the invention, the digital loop filter comprises a coefficient memory for storing signal gain coefficients and has a multiplexer which is controlled by the phase difference signal and passes on the stored signal gain coefficients to a multiplier, which multiplies the phase difference signal by the signal gain coefficient that is passed on. The coefficient memory for the digital loop filter according to the invention is preferably programmable. In an alternative embodiment of the PLL circuit according to the invention, the loop filter is analog. The control circuit is preferably a circuit for clock and data recovery within a receiver, with the recovered clock signal being applied to the phase comparison circuit. The invention furthermore provides a method for eliminating self-jitter in a signal which is received by a control circuit, having the following steps, namely:calculation of the phase difference between the phase of the signal which is received by the control circuit and a nominal phase, amplification of the signal which is received by the control circuit, with the received signal being amplified in a nonlinear manner as a function of the calculated phase difference. In one preferred embodiment of the method according to the invention for eliminating self-jitter in a signal which is received by a control circuit, the calculated phase difference is compared with programmable phase difference threshold values, with the signal which is received by the control circuit being amplified with a signal gain factor of zero in a first transmission range for a small phase difference up to a first phase difference threshold value, with the signal which is received by the control circuit being amplified in a nonlinear manner by programmable signal gain factors as a function of the calculated phase difference in a second transmission range for a medium phase difference between the first phase difference threshold value and a second phase difference threshold value, and with the signal which is received by the control circuit being output with a constant maximum signal amplitude in a third transmission range for a large phase difference which is greater than the phase difference second threshold value. The method according to the invention is preferably carried out by means of a signal processor. The signal processor is preferably a digital signal processor DSP.

FIG. 7 shows a flowchart of one preferred embodiment of the method according to the invention for eliminating self-jitter in a received signal.     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES FIG. 3a shows a first embodiment of a loop filter with a nonlinear transfer function for the PLL circuit according to the invention for eliminating the self-jitter in a received signal. The loop filter 1 which is illustrated in FIG. 3 is digital. In an alternative embodiment, the loop filter is analog. The digital loop filter 1 which is illustrated in FIG. 3a is a nonlinear P-regulator, which is used in the PLL circuit according to the invention. The digital loop filter 1 has a signal input 2 for receiving a digital data discrepancy signal via a signal line 3. The phase difference signal which is applied to the signal input 2 is passed via an internal line 4 to a branching node 5 and, via an internal control line 6, controls a multiplexer 7 that is contained in the loop filter 1. The branching node 5 is furthermore connected via an internal line 8 to a multiplier 9. The output of the multiplexer 7 is likewise connected via a line 10 to the multiplier 9. The multiplier 9 multiplies the output value from the multiplexer 7 by the phase difference value or phase difference signal, and emits the weighted phase difference signal via a line 11 to a signal output 12 from the digital loop filter 1. The multiplexer 7 has a large number of signal inputs 13, which are connected via lines 14 to coefficient storage locations 15 within a register 16. The signal gain coefficients KI of the register 16 are variable or programmable in one embodiment of the PLL circuit according to the invention. The multiplexer 7 is controlled via the control line 6 by the phase difference signal which is applied to the input 2 of the digital loop filter 2, and passes on one input 13-i to the output line 10 for multiplication by the phase difference signal, as a function of the applied phase difference value. FIG. 3b shows a simplified embodiment of the digital loop filter 1 according to the invention. In this embodiment, the output values of the transfer function are stored directly in the memory 16. The advantage of this embodiment is that no multipliers are required. FIG. 4a shows the transfer function for one exemplary embodiment of the digital loop filter 1 according to the invention, as is illustrated in FIGS. 3a, 3b. The phase difference value which is applied to the signal input 2 of the digital loop filter 1 is multiplied in accordance with the nonlinear transfer function setting, and is emitted as a weighted phase difference value at the output 12 of the loop filter 1. As can be seen from FIG. 4a, the transfer function is point-symmetrical about the phase difference value zero. In a first transmission range I of the loop filter 1, the phase difference value is small and the stored signal gain coefficients for this transmission range are zero up to a first phase difference threshold value PD1. If the phase difference value which is applied to the signal input 2 of the loop filter 1 is in the first transmission range I, that is to say between the negative first phase difference threshold value PD1 and the positive threshold value &plus;PD1, the multiplexer 7 passes on the signal gain coefficient Ki to the output 10 as a function of the phase difference value, this being the signal gain coefficient Ki which is stored in the register 16 and has the value zero. If the phase difference value is in a second transmission range II, that is to say between the first phase difference threshold value PD1 and a second phase difference threshold value PD2, the applied phase difference value is amplified nonlinearly. In a further embodiment, the phase difference is amplified linearly in the range II. If the applied phase difference value is in a third transmission range III, that is to say the phase difference is greater than the second threshold value PD2, the second phase difference value is limited to a maximum value outmax. In an alternative embodiment, the loop filter 1 may be analog. FIG. 4b shows a transfer function of a loop filter 1 which is formed from analog components. The self-jitter on the signal which is emitted by the clock and data recovery circuit CDR has small amplitudes. In the transmission range I, the input jitter is completely removed or eliminated by the digital loop filter 1 according to the invention, because the signal gain factor is zero. In the range II, that is to say between the first phase difference threshold value PD1 and the second phase difference threshold value PD2, the applied phase difference signal is not amplified linearly in accordance with the coefficient settings. If the applied phase difference value is above the second threshold value or maximum value PD2, the phase difference value or the phase difference signal is multiplied or amplified by a maximum signal gain factor kmax to form a maximum output signal outmax. In consequence, the PLL circuit is able to follow the signal with amplitudes beyond this maximum value, without any constraint. FIG. 5 shows an application example for the PLL circuit according to the invention for eliminating self-jitter. The PLL circuit 17 according to the invention contains the loop filter 1 illustrated in FIG. 3. The PLL circuit 17 also contains a phase comparison circuit 18 with a first signal input 19 and a second signal input 20. The phase comparison circuit 18 has a signal output 21, which is connected via a line 22 to the input 2 of the digital loop filter 1. The phase comparison circuit 18 is connected via its signal input 19 and an internal line 23 to an input 24 of the PLL circuit 17. The output 12 of the loop filter 1 is connected via a line 25 to an input 26 of a controlled oscillator 27. If the PLL circuit 17 according to the invention is digital, the controlled oscillator 27 is a digitally controlled oscillator DCO. If the PLL circuit 17 according to the invention is analog, one preferred embodiment of the oscillator 27 is a voltage-controlled oscillator VCO. The controlled oscillator 27 has a signal output 28, which is connected via a line 29 to an output 30 of the PLL circuit 17. Furthermore, the output 28 of the oscillator 27 is connected via a feedback line 31 to the second signal input 20 of the phase comparison circuit 18. In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG. 5, a clock and data recovery circuit 31 within a receiver receives data via data lines 32. The clock and data recovery circuit uses the received data to obtain the reception clock for the data signal, and emits the clock signal CDR-CLK that is obtained via a clock line 33 to the signal input 24 of the PLL circuit 17. The received clock signal CDR-CLK is used as a reference clock signal for the PLL circuit 17, and is passed via the internal line 23 to the first signal input 19 of the phase comparison circuit 18. The phase comparison circuit 18 compares the phase of the applied reference clock signal with the phase of the output signal, which is fed back via the line 31, from the controlled oscillator 27 and forms a phase difference signal, which is applied via the line 22 to the signal input 2 of the loop filter 1. The loop filter 1 filters the phase difference signal by amplifying the signal using a transfer function as illustrated in FIG. 4. The signal gain of the applied phase difference signal or phase difference value is in this case nonlinear, and the signal amplification is preferably carried out using a transfer function which is point-symmetrical about the zero value of the phase difference signal. The PLL circuit 17 according to the invention completely suppresses the self-jitter that is produced by the CDR circuit 31, by virtue of the transmission range I. The PLL circuit 17 is, however, able to follow a slow frequency change in the reference clock signal CDR-CLK without any constraint. If the data transmission rate of the data signal which is applied to the CDR circuit 31 changes, the clock frequency of the stabilized clock signal which is produced by the PLL circuit 17 follows this data frequency change. In the example shown in FIG. 5, the signal output of the PLL circuit 17 is connected via a clock line 34 to a clock signal input 35 of a data register 36. On the input side, the data register 36 is connected to data lines 37 from the clock and data recovery circuit 31, and receives the recovered data. The data register 36 is clocked by means of the stabilized clock signal CLKout, which has had the self-jitter from the CDR circuit 31 removed from it, so that the data which is emitted from the data register 36 via data lines 38 has likewise had the self-jitter from the CDR circuit 31 removed from it. If the data transmission rate of the data which is received by the CDR circuit 31, and hence the frequency of the reference clock signal CDR-CLK which has been generated, change, the PLL circuit 17 follows this frequency change and clocks the data register 36 at the changed clock frequency. This ensures that the data reception frequency of the data which is received by the CDR circuit 17, and that the clock rate of the stabilized clock signal CLKout which is emitted from the PLL circuit 17 do not differ from one another, so that no data losses can occur. FIG. 6a shows the self-jitter on the recovered reference clock signal CDR-CLK, which is emitted by the CDR circuit 31, at the signal input 24 of the PLL circuit 17. FIG. 6b shows the regulated self-jitter on the stabilized clock signal CLKout, which is emitted from the PLL circuit 17, at the signal output 30 of the PLL circuit 17 with an input signal (in this case the self-jitter CDR) as shown in FIG. 6a. As can be seen from FIG. 6b, the intrinsic jitter or the self-jitter of the CDR circuit 31 is removed completely by the PLL circuit 17 according to the invention. The intrinsic jitter is removed about the zero point with the aid of a nonlinear P-regulator 1 or of the nonlinear loop filter 1. FIG. 7 shows a flowchart of a particularly preferred embodiment of the method according to the invention for eliminating the self-jitter of a signal which is emitted by the control circuit 31. In the method according to the invention, the phase difference between the phase of the signal which is received by the control circuit and a nominal phase is determined first of all, and the signal which is received by the control circuit is then amplified in a nonlinear manner as a function of the determined phase difference value. In this case, the calculated phase difference is preferably compared with programmable phase difference threshold values. After a starting step S0, the phase difference or the phase difference value between the phase of the received reference clock signal and a nominal phase are calculated in a first step S1. The calculated phase difference value (phase error) PE is compared with a maximum threshold value PD2 in a step S2. If the phase error PE is greater than the maximum second threshold value PD2, the applied phase difference signal or the phase difference value PE is amplified by a maximum signal gain factor kmax in a step S3, and is output as the maximum output signal Outmax, with the procedure ending in step S11. If the phase error or the phase difference PE as calculated in the step S1 is less than the second maximum second phase difference threshold value PD2, the phase difference is compared in a step S4 with a second, lower threshold value PD1. If it is found that the determined phase difference PE is greater than the first, lower threshold value PD1, the phase difference PE is emitted, multiplied in a nonlinear manner by the programmed signal gain factors ki in a step S5, and the procedure is ended in step S11. If it is found in the step S4 that the calculated phase difference value PE is also below the first, lower threshold value PD1, the phase difference PE is compared with the negative first threshold value PD1 in a step S6. If the phase difference value PE is greater than the negative first threshold value PD1, the phase difference is in the transmission range I of the transfer function illustrated in FIG. 4, and the phase difference value is multiplied by a signal gain factor of zero in a step S7, and the procedure is ended in step S11. This eliminates the self-jitter, with its small amplitudes. If it is found in step S6 that the phase difference is less than the negative first threshold value PD1, a check is carried out in a step S8 to determine whether the calculated phase difference value PE is greater than or less than the negative second maximum threshold value PD2. If the phase difference PE is greater than the negative second threshold value PD2, the phase difference value is in the transmission range IIB, and the phase difference PE is multiplied in accordance with a nonlinear transfer function by a signal gain factor Ki in a step S9, and the procedure is ended in step S11. If the calculated phase difference PE is less than the negative second phase difference value PD2, and the phase difference value is thus in the transfer function range IIIB, the phase difference value is multiplied in a step S10 by a maximum gain factor kmax to form the maximum possible negative output signal value Outmax, is output, and the procedure is ended in step S11. The method according to the invention is preferably implemented in a signal processor. The signal processor is preferably a digital signal processor DSP. The method according to the invention, as it is illustrated in FIG. 7, can also be used with more complex filters. If the mid-frequency of the input signal which is applied to the PLL circuit is not identical to the mid-frequency of the PLL, then a PI-regulator is used as the loop regulator. In this case, the P-regulator is formed within the PI-regulator by the digital loop filter 1 according to the invention. The I-regulator is connected in parallel with the P-regulator. The elimination of the self-jitter by means of the PLL circuit 17 according to the invention results in compliance with the jitter standard E1ETS300011/ITU-TI.431 Multiple Access and the jitter standard T1G824/ITU-TI.431. In addition to complying with the jitter standards, the P-regulator according to the invention and the loop filter 1 according to the invention offer the advantage that they reduce the power consumption and the crosstalk up to a maximum value.

This avoids the problems of temperature dependence, low-frequency oscillation, and backward tuning which can occur when using an inductor in a load-pulled oscillator. ', '   CROSS-REFERENCE TO OTHER APPLICATION This application claims priority from Ser. No. 60/265,365, filed Jan. 31, 2001, which is hereby incorporated by reference.     BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to load-pulled oscillator circuits and systems. Background: Biasing Circuits DC Biasing circuits for oscillators typically incorporate radio frequency (RF) chokes (i.e. high inductance rf blocking inductors), with a shunt capacitance to ground immediately after the choke. This provides a high impedance to the RF while providing a DC path for the biasing of the active devices. (Providing a high RF impedance helps to avoid unwanted RF circuit paths which can cause unwanted oscillation modes, and also avoids damping of the RF oscillation.) This conventional method encounters some difficulties in broadband RF circuits. At microwave frequencies almost any real-world passive device with have substantial reactance from series inductances and shunt capacitances, so that self-resonances can occur. For circuits which operate only over a limited frequency range this can usually be avoided by appropriate component selection, but for circuits which operate over a frequency range of an octave or more (i.e. whose highest required operating frequency is double the lowest) these resonances can be a problem. Even if the choke does not hit resonance as a single lumped element, partial resonances within the windings or leads can still cause frequency-dependent impedance changes, and this may cause the RF choke to be less than adequate isolation at some frequencies. Also, inductance-generated voltage spikes are detrimental to circuit and device performance. One way to keep the choke&apos;s impedance high over a range of frequencies would be to load the choke with ferrites or other magnetic materials. However, such materials typically have a large temperature coefficient, which can cause undesirable frequency shifts in oscillators. Even small lead or inter-winding resonances can affect the tuning characteristics of oscillators, causing power dips and (worse yet) backwards tuning (where frequency is NOT monotonically dependent on tuning voltage in a varactor tuned oscillator). Background: Load-Pulled Oscillators Load-pulled oscillators are an important technique for RF monitoring. A free-running oscillator, typically at VHF or higher frequencies, is electromagnetically coupled to some environment which is desired to be characterized. (For example, an unknown oil/water/gas composition can be flowed through a coaxial probe section.) Since the oscillator is not isolated from the environment being measured, changes in that environment will pull the frequency of oscillation. By monitoring shifts in the frequency of oscillation, changes in the environment being monitored can be seen with great precision. (For example, in compositional monitoring of wellhead flows of oil/gas/water mixtures, the environment being monitored is a medium having a variable composition, and changes in the composition are seen as shifts in the oscillation frequency for a given tuning voltage.) Such circuits are described e.g. in published PCT application WO 91/08469 (published 13 Jun. 1991), which is hereby incorporated by reference. The load pulled oscillator requires a topology which will support oscillations throughout a change in the load impedance from the capacitive to inductive loading. Typically such an oscillator must cover octave or more bandwidths and remain capable of oscillating into any load impedance or phase within its range. In order to design a system to be capable of this range, biasing and impedance effects of the associated DC networks must be considered from an RF or microwave perspective. DC biasing achieved from the use of RF chokes and resistors is effective only if the chokes are effectively an open with no resonances, and if the combinations of inductance, resistance and capacitance don&apos;t limit the ability of the circuit to respond broad band. Use of standard commercial grade inductors as RF chokes in the frequency range of 100 MHz to 1 GHz was accomplished by use of 100 nH to 2200 microH inductors of the coil variety. The problems were that for high frequency oscillators, the lower inductance allowed undesired low frequency oscillations to occur at certain loads and frequencies. The larger inductors supplied excellent blocking, but created problems at the second harmonic of the frequency, thus causing backward tuning and decrease in load pull sensitivities. These same problems can be even worse at higher microwave frequencies. These problems relate to self-resonance characteristics of the RF choke. The need for broadband chokes in load pulled oscillators is particularly severe, since any change in frequency or impact on the oscillator performance limits the ability to resolve microwave parameters. Ideally, when such systems are used for measurement of material parameters, the oscillator frequency will respond very precisely to changes in the load impedance; but when components of the circuit are also changing their impedance as the oscillator frequency shifts, the relation between oscillator frequency and load impedance becomes less direct. Improved RF Choke Bias Scheme for Load Pulled Oscillators Load-pulled oscillators differ fundamentally from other RF circuits, in that the load-pulled oscillator is NOT required to be insensitive to variations in the circuit stages which follow it: the whole purpose of the load-pulled oscillator circuit is to respond to changes in load impedance, so isolation and similar techniques are not applicable. The present inventor has realized that in load-pulled-oscillators, unlike other RF oscillators, temperature dependence and impedance changes in the blocking chokes are important problems. The present application therefore teaches a new way to solve this problem: the innovative circuits combine a load-pulled oscillator with a blocking stage which uses a self-biased active device to emulate an RF choke. The use of an active choke-emulating stage provides dynamic control of performance while creating an open circuit without parasitic resonances. The disclosed innovations, in various embodiments, provide one or more of at least the following advantages: monotonic tuning; reduced temperature dependence; reduced risk of unwanted frequency hop; and reduced risk of spectral breakup.     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING The disclosed inventions will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, which show important sample embodiments of the invention and which are incorporated in the specification hereof by reference, wherein: FIG. 1 shows a sample embodiment of a load-pulled oscillator with an inductorless active choke stage. FIG. 2 shows a conventional load-pulled oscillator with a conventional choke inductor. FIG. 3 shows a more detailed realization of a load-pulled oscillator with an inductorless active choke stage. FIGS. 4A and 4B are Smith charts showing the variation of complex impedance with frequency of the inductorless active choke stage of FIG. 3.     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The numerous innovative teachings of the present application will be described with particular reference to the presently preferred embodiment (by way of example, and not of limitation). In order to design a load-pulled system with superior performance, biasing and impedance effects of the associated DC networks must be considered from an RF or microwave perspective. DC biasing achieved from the use of RF chokes and resistors is effective only if the chokes are an open circuit with no resonances, and if the combinations of inductance, resistance and capacitance do not limit the ability of the circuit to respond broad band (i.e. across a frequency range of more than an octave). Use of standard commercial grade inductors as RF chokes in the frequency range of 100 MHz to 1 GHz was accomplished by use of surface-mounted 100 nH to 2200 &mgr;H inductors of the coil variety. The problems were that for high frequency oscillators, the lower inductance resulted in low power, poor isolation from DC circuit parasitics, and undesirable low frequency oscillations at certain loads and frequencies. The larger inductors supplied excellent blocking, but created problems at the second harmonic of the frequency, thus causing backward tuning and decrease in load pull sensitivities (corresponding to self-resonances or to ferrite dependence on temperature). These same problems become worse as frequencies range higher into the microwave region. The present application teaches the use of a self biased active device (e.g. a junction FET) in the emitter circuit instead of the usual RF choke and bias resistor. This provides a dynamic current control due to the action of the resistor in the source of the FET. This resistor maintains a voltage from gate to source which will regulate the current dynamically. This coupled with the biased FET&apos;s high impedance will provide an excellent RF choke without the impact of parasitic resonances. The physical path is shorter and therefore the electrical length is reduced from inductor type of chokes. Additionally, the dynamic action of the FET coupled with the reduction in inductance will reduce the voltages seen at the emitter and therefore, will clean up spurious performance which is generated by large voltage swings causing BE avalanche and therefore generating harmonics. An additional capacitor across the source resistor can be implemented which will provide DC stability and prevent RF dynamic biasing if for some reason this is required. The use of an active device to control the current in the load pulled oscillator circuit provides a dynamic control of the performance while creating an open circuit without parasitic resonances. When a bipolar transistor is used as the oscillator&apos;s active device, the effect of the base voltage set by the DC bias also sets the emitter voltage (a diode drop higher, i.e. about 0.6V.) The FET&apos;s flat F/V curves help to maintain the DC bias at a constant current and voltage at the connection between the drain of the JFET and the emitter of the bipolar. This is the definition of a dynamic open circuit, i.e. delta V over delta I is constant (if the FET responds as quickly as the gain device), so that an open circuit load line results. FIG. 1 shows a sample embodiment of a load-pulled oscillator with an inductorless active choke stage. The DC supply to the emitter terminal of the gain device T1 is provided by the active choke circuit which includes R3, CS, and JFET T2. FIG. 2 shows a conventional load-pulled oscillator with a conventional choke inductor. Note that in this case the RF Choke Circuit merely includes an inductor L2, with resistor R3 and capacitor C4. FIG. 3 shows a more detailed realization of a load-pulled oscillator with an inductorless active choke stage. The conventional configuration of FIG. 2 is shown merely as an alternative, with dashed connections. Note also that capacitors C4 and C5 are not used, although some parasitic capacitance is likely to be present. JFET Q8 provides an active choke stage. FIG. 4B is a Smith charts showing the variation of complex impedance of the alternative version of FIG. 3, using the conventional inductor RFC (shown with the dashed connections) and NOT the JFET bias element Q8. Note that a loop is observed going from 400 MHz through 800 to 1300 MHz. This indicates the occurrence of a self resonance at about 800 MHz, and produces an undesirably low impedance at that frequency. FIG. 4A is a Smith chart showing the variation of complex impedance with frequency of the inductorless active choke stage of FIG. 3. Note that the magnitude of impedance is much more constant than in FIG. 4B.

According to another disclosed class of innovative embodiments, there is provided: A system, comprising: a load-pulled oscillator circuit which includes an RF gain stage comprising at least a first active device, and an RF-blocking stage, interposed between said gain stage and at least one power supply voltage, and incorporating a second active device which is connected to at least partially emulate an RF choke; a probe which is connected to said output terminal, and which is electromagnetically coupled to a measurement environment of interest; and a monitoring circuit which observes frequency shifts of said oscillator circuit. According to another disclosed class of innovative embodiments, there is provided: A method of operating a load-pulled oscillator, comprising the steps of: allowing a gain stage, which comprises at least a first active device, to oscillate while being pulled by reactance seen at a load connection; and emulating an RF choke, to provide an RF-isolated supply voltage to said gain stage, using a second active device. Modifications and Variations As will be recognized by those skilled in the art, the innovative concepts described in the present application can be modified and varied over a tremendous range of applications, and accordingly the scope of patented subject matter is not limited by any of the specific exemplary teachings given. The active device in the blocking stage does not strictly have to be a JFET, but can optionally be implemented with a variety of device technologies, as long as the device is fast enough to track the frequency of the gain stage. (Surprisingly, a device in the blocking stage which does not have adequate bandwidth will typically produce increased harmonics at its output; this is because the gain stage&apos;s waveform is not being tracked accurately.) For example, in one class of embodiments the active blocking stage is implemented by a MESFET. For another example, in one class of embodiments the active blocking stage is implemented by a MOSFET. Self-biasing can be provided, for example, by tying gate to drain, as in a depletion-load configuration. For another example, in one class of embodiments the active blocking stage is implemented by a HEMT. Optionally the disclosed circuit innovations can be used in implementations which include more than one active blocking stage. Optionally the disclosed circuit innovations can also be used with load-pulled oscillators which include more than one gain stage. Optionally the disclosed circuit innovations can also be used with a variety of gain stage topologies other than that shown, which can include discrete, integrated, and/or parasitic feedback elements. Optionally the disclosed circuit innovations can also be used with oscillators which combine one or more load-pulled stages with one or more other stages. Optionally the disclosed circuit innovations can also be used with load-pulled oscillators in which a self-biased active blocking stage is combined with a small (and preferably air-coil) inductor. Optionally the disclosed circuit innovations can also be used with a load-pulled oscillator in which an active blocking stage is implemented using a fast active device which amplifies the apparent inductance of a small inductor (preferably an inductor which is loaded by a damping material which preferentially suppresses harmonics). For example, in one class of contemplated embodiments the innovative choke emulation can be used on the collector side of the gain device. In another sample one class of contemplated embodiments the innovative choke emulation can be used in the varactor tuning voltage connection. (In this case the range of tuning voltages would have to be restricted, if the circuit implementation is like that of FIG. 3, to voltages above a certain minimum value, e.g. 5V or so.)

Field of the Invention The present invention relates to an oscillator device, such as a crystal oscillator device, and an electronic apparatus, such as a cellular phone, using the oscillator device. 2. Description of the Related Art A known piezoelectric oscillator device is disclosed in Japanese Utility Model No. 3030652. FIG. 12 is a circuit diagram of a piezoelectric oscillator device 1 that is substantially the same as the known piezoelectric oscillator device. The oscillator device 1 includes an oscillation circuit 2 and a buffer amplifier circuit 3. The oscillation circuit 2 is a modified grounded-collector Colpitts oscillation circuit and the buffer amplifier circuit 3 is a grounded-base buffer amplifier circuit. An oscillation NPN transistor 2a in the oscillation circuit 2 and a buffer amplifier NPN transistor 3a in the buffer amplifier circuit 3 are connected in series to a power supply. A resistor 4a is connected between the emitter of the transistor 2a and ground. Also, the collector of the transistor 2a is connected to the emitter of the transistor 3a. A resistor 4b is connected between the collector of the transistor 3a and a power terminal 5. The collector of the transistor 3a is connected to an output terminal 7 via a capacitor 6. Accordingly, in the oscillator device 1, a high-frequency component output from the collector of the transistor 2a is input to the emitter of the transistor 3a, is buffer-amplified by the buffer amplifier circuit 3, and is output from the output terminal 7 via the capacitor 6. In the oscillator device 1, a coupling capacitor is omitted between the oscillation circuit 2 and the buffer amplifier circuit 3, thus reducing the size and cost of the oscillator device. However, the two resistors 4a and 4b are essential in the oscillator device 1 for the following reasons. Since the resistor 4a functions as an emitter resistance for a load of the oscillation circuit 2, negative resistance is not generated and the oscillation circuit 2 does not oscillate when the resistor 4a is removed. Further, since the resistor 4b functions as a resistance for a load of the buffer amplifier circuit 3, output cannot be taken from the buffer amplifier circuit 3 when the resistor 4b is removed. Also, in the oscillator device 1, the principal current which flows from the power terminal 5 through the transistors 3a and 2a to the ground causes a voltage drop at the resistors 4b and 4a. As a result, voltages Vce which are applied between the collector and emitter of the transistor 2a, and between the collector and emitter of the transistor 3a are reduced by the voltage drop. These drops in the voltages Vce must be prevented as much as possible because they cause degradation in the amplification factor and power efficiency of the oscillator device 1. Further, many electronic apparatuses require a device which can be operated with a low-voltage power supply, and thus it is difficult to apply a sufficient voltage to the oscillator device 1. In addition, in the oscillator device 1, the two resistors 4a and 4b consume extra power and occupy extra space, thus increasing the cost of the device. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In order to overcome the above-described problems, preferred embodiments of the present invention provide an oscillator device having fewer electronic components and an electronic apparatus including such a novel oscillator device. Preferred embodiments of the present invention provide an oscillator device which operates with high efficiency at a low power supply voltage and an electronic apparatus including such a oscillator device.

Also, the collector of the transistor 22 is connected to a power terminal 40, to which a positive-polarity power supply (not shown) is connected. As the transistor 32, a PNP transistor is preferably used. The base of the transistor 32 is grounded via a capacitor 34. The capacitor 34 is used in the grounded-base buffer amplifier circuit. A resistor 36 is connected between the collector of the transistor 32 and ground. The resistor 36 functions as a load of the buffer amplifier circuit 30. A resistor 42a is connected between the power terminal 40 and the base of the transistor 22. A resistor 42b is connected between the base of the transistor 22 and the base of the transistor 32. Further, a resistor 42c is connected between the base of the transistor 22 and ground. These resistors 42a to 42c apply individual bias voltages to the base of the transistor 22 and the base of the transistor 32. The collector of the transistor 32 is connected to an output terminal 52 via a coupling capacitor 50. In the oscillator device 10, a high-frequency component output from the emitter of the transistor 22 is input to the emitter of the transistor 32, is buffer-amplified in the buffer amplifier circuit 30, and is output from the output terminal 52 via the capacitor 50. In the oscillator device 10, since the buffer amplifier circuit 30 also functions as the load of the oscillation circuit 20, a resistor that functions as the load connected to the oscillation circuit is not required. As a result, the number of resistors in the current path between the power supply and its ground is reduced by 1. Therefore, in the oscillator device 10, the usage efficiency of the power supply is greatly improved, the power consumption is significantly reduced, the size oscillator device is miniaturized because of the reduction in the space required for providing resistors on a circuit board, and the cost is greatly reduced, as compared with the oscillator device 1 shown in FIG. 12. Further, in the oscillator device 10, the transistor 22 and the transistor 32 are connected in series to the power supply. In this configuration, the emitter of the transistor 22 is connected to the emitter of the transistor 32 and an oscillation output is taken from the emitter of the transistor 22. Accordingly, the oscillation circuit 20 is very strongly coupled to the buffer amplifier circuit 30 and design freedom is greatly improved. Also, in the oscillator device 10, the spectral purity of a high-frequency oscillation signal is greatly increased because bipolar transistors, such as NPN transistors or PNP transistors, are used since they cause less flicker noise than field-effect transistors (FET). That is, the oscillator device 10 causes less phase noise as compared to an oscillator device using an FET, and thus is preferable for use as a crystal oscillator device, especially a temperature-compensated crystal oscillator device. In the oscillator device 10, a PNP transistor having a low cutoff frequency is used as the buffer amplifier transistor 32. However, this does not cause any problems because the gain of a buffer amplifier transistor generally does not have to be high. FIG. 2 shows an example of an equivalent circuit of the oscillator device shown in FIG. 1. In FIG. 2, the piezoelectric oscillator 26 is defined by a circuit in which a capacitor 26d is connected in parallel to a series circuit including a resistor 26a, a capacitor 26b, and an inductor 26c. A 9-volt power supply 60 is connected to the power terminal 40 and a resistor 62 that functions as a load is connected between the output terminal 52 and the ground. FIG. 3 is a graph showing the result obtained by performing circuit analysis of an example of the oscillator device 10 shown in FIG. 2 by a computer using known software. In the example of oscillator device 10 shown in FIG. 2, a 2SC4561 transistor is used as the transistor 22. Additionally, a 10000 pF capacitor, a 500 pF capacitor, and a 200 pF capacitor are used as the capacitors 24a, 24b, and 24c, respectively. Further, the piezoelectric oscillator 26 is defined by a circuit having a series circuit including a resistor 26a of 10 &OHgr;, a capacitor 26b of 0.49 pF, and an inductor 26c of 0.03148 H, and a capacitor 26d of 20 pF connected in parallel to the series circuit. A 2SA1747 transistor is used as the transistor 32. A 2000 pF capacitor and a 10 pF capacitor are used as the capacitors 34 and 50, respectively. Further, a 1000 &OHgr; resistor, a 5 k&OHgr; resistor, a 10 k&OHgr; resistor, a 10 k&OHgr; resistor, and a 100 k&OHgr; resistor are used as the resistors 36, 42a, 42b, 42c, and 62, respectively. As is apparent from the graph shown in FIG. 3, the oscillator device 10 shown in FIG. 2 operates very efficiently. FIG. 4 is a circuit diagram showing another preferred embodiment of the oscillator device according to the present invention. The oscillator device 10 shown in FIG. 4 differs from the one shown in FIG. 1 in that a PNP transistor is used as the transistor 22 and an NPN transistor is used as the transistor 32. Further, a negative-polarity power supply (not shown) is connected to the power terminal 40. Accordingly, in the oscillator device 10 shown in FIG. 4, the current direction is opposite to that in the oscillator device 10 shown in FIG. 1, but the operation is the same. Therefore, the oscillator device 10 shown in FIG. 4 achieves the same advantages as those of the oscillator device 10 shown in FIG. 1. FIG. 5 is a circuit diagram showing another preferred embodiment of the oscillator device according to the present invention. The oscillator device 10 shown in FIG. 5 differs from the one shown in FIG. 1 in that a stripline resonator 27 is used instead of the crystal oscillator 26. The stripline resonator 27 and a capacitor 27a are connected in series between the base of the transistor 22 and ground. The oscillator device 10 shown in FIG. 5 operates in the same manner and achieves the same advantages as the oscillator device 10 shown in FIG. 1, except that the oscillator device is not a crystal oscillator device. FIG. 6 is a circuit diagram showing another preferred embodiment of the oscillator device according to the present invention. The oscillator device 10 shown in FIG. 6 differs from the one shown in FIG. 4 in that a stripline resonator 27 is used instead of the crystal oscillator 26. The stripline resonator 27 and a capacitor 27a are connected in series between the base of the transistor 22 and ground. The oscillator device 10 shown in FIG. 6 operates in the same manner and achieves the same advantages as the oscillator device 10 shown in FIG. 4, except that the oscillator device is not a crystal oscillator device. Incidentally, in each of the above-described oscillator devices 10, the two transistors used as the transistor 22 and the transistor 32 may be integrated in a single package. Also, in each of the above-described oscillator devices 10, between the base of the transistor 22 and ground, a circuit element, such as a variable capacitance element, may be connected in series or in parallel to the crystal oscillator 26 or the stripline resonator 27. By connecting such a circuit element in order to change the circuit constant thereof, the oscillation frequency of the oscillation circuit 20 can be adjusted. For example, when the load is a variable capacitance element, changing the voltage applied to the variable capacitance element, as shown in FIG. 14, results in a change in capacitance of the variable capacitance element, and thus the oscillation frequency of the oscillation circuit 20 is changed. Further, in each of the above-described oscillator devices 10, an inductor 36, as shown in FIG. 13, that functions as a load may be connected between the collector of the transistor 32 and ground, instead of the resistor 36. Also, in each of the above-described oscillator devices 10, any one of the resistors 42a, 42b, and 42c may be removed to apply a bias voltage to the base of the transistor 22 and the base of the transistor 32. FIG. 7 shows a circuit diagram of another preferred embodiment of the oscillator device according to the present invention. In FIG. 7, the oscillator device 10 includes an oscillation NPN bipolar transistor Q3, a buffer-amplifier P-channel junction FET Q4, a crystal oscillator X1, resistors R6 to R8, and capacitors CG to C9. Generally, a bipolar transistor causes less flicker noise than an FET. Thus, a bipolar transistor reduces phase noise of an oscillation signal of an oscillator device and is preferable for an active element for oscillation. A positive-polarity power supply voltage is applied to a power terminal &plus;VCC. The power terminal &plus;VCC is grounded via the capacitor C7 and is connected to the collector of the transistor Q3. The emitter of the transistor Q3 is grounded via the capacitor C9 and connected to the source of the FET Q4. The gate of the FET Q4 is grounded. The drain of the FET Q4 is connected to an output terminal Po via the capacitor C6 and is grounded via the resistor R6 which functions as a load impedance element. Also, the power terminal &plus;VCC is grounded via the resistors R7 and R8. The node between the resistors R7 and RB is connected to the base of the transistor Q3 and is grounded via the crystal oscillator X1. The capacitor C8 is connected between the base and emitter of the transistor Q3. The oscillator device 10 includes a Colpitts oscillation circuit. That is, the collector of the transistor Q3 is grounded in a high-frequency state via the capacitor C7, the crystal oscillator X1 is connected between the collector and base, the capacitor C8 is connected between the base and emitter, and the capacitor C9 is connected between the collector and emitter. On the other hand, a buffer amplifier circuit including the FET Q4 defines a buffer amplifier circuit in which the gate is DC-grounded and also high-frequency-grounded. An oscillation signal output from the emitter of the transistor Q3 is input to the source of the FET Q4 and is amplified, and then is output from the drain of the FET Q4 to the output terminal Po via the capacitor C6. The principal current in the oscillator device 10 flows between the collector and emitter of the transistor Q3, between the source and drain of the FET Q4, and through the resistor R6. That is, the transistor Q3 and the FET Q4 are connected in series with respect to the power supply. The resistors R7 and R8 function as bias resistors for applying base current to the transistor Q3. Now, the buffer amplifier circuit including the FET Q4 is described. The FET Q4 is a P-channel FET. When current flows through the resistor R6, the drain potential of the FET Q4 becomes greater than the gate potential thereof. That is, the gate potential becomes less than the drain potential and the FET Q4 operates by self-biasing. From the viewpoint of the transistor Q3, the buffer amplifier circuit which operates in the manner described above appears to be a load resistor connected to the emitter. Accordingly, the oscillation circuit including the transistor Q3 is a grounded-collector Colpitts oscillation circuit in which the buffer amplifier circuit functions as a load resistor. As described above, in the oscillator device 10, the buffer amplifier circuit also functions as a load resistor of the oscillation circuit, and a separate load resistor is not required. Thus, in this case, much less power consumption is required as compared to the known oscillator device 1. Further, the voltage between the collector and emitter of the transistor Q3 and the voltage between the source and drain of the FET Q4 are higher than in the known oscillator device because a separate load resistor is not required. Consequently, the amplification factor and the power efficiency are greatly improved. In addition, the oscillator device 10 has fewer components than the known oscillator device 1. That is, the number of resistors is 2 less and the number of capacitors is 1 less than the conventional device. Accordingly, the number of components is reduced and the size of the oscillator device of preferred embodiments of the present invention is reduced. In the oscillator device 10, the drain of the FET Q4 is grounded via the resistor R6 that functions as a load impedance element. However, a radio frequency choke (RFC) coil may also be used as the load impedance element. In that case, however, the drain potential of the FET Q4 becomes 0 V for DC-voltage, that is, the same as the gate potential. Thus, a normally-on FET, such as a depletion FET, in which an adequate amount of current flows even if the voltage between the drain and gate is 0 V and preferable transconductance is obtained, is used as the FET Q4. FIG. 8 is a circuit diagram of another preferred embodiment of the oscillator device according to the present invention. In FIG. 8, like reference numerals depict the identical or equivalent components to those in FIG. 7 and the corresponding description is omitted. In FIG. 8, an oscillator device 20 includes a PNP bipolar transistor Q5 instead of the transistor Q3 in the oscillator device 10 and an N-channel junction FET Q6 instead of the FET Q4 in the oscillator device 10. The transistor Q5 and the FET Q6 are connected to other components in the same manner as in the oscillator device 10. Further, a negative-polarity power supply voltage is applied to a power terminal Vcc. In the oscillator device 20, the polarity of the channel is reversed in the transistor for the oscillation circuit and the FET for the buffer amplifier circuit compared with the oscillator device 10, and accordingly the polarity of the power supply is reversed. Therefore, the oscillator device 20 has substantially the same operation and advantages as those of the oscillator device 10. FIG. 9 is a circuit diagram of another preferred embodiment of the oscillator device according to the present invention. In FIG. 9, like reference numerals depict the identical or equivalent components to those in FIG. 7 and the corresponding description is omitted. In FIG. 9, an oscillator device 30 includes a capacitor C10, an inductance element L1, an RFC coil L2, and a varactor diode VD instead of the crystal oscillator X1 in the oscillator device 10 in FIG. 7. One end of the inductance element L1 is connected to the node between the resistors R7 and R8, that is, the base of the transistor Q3. The other end of the inductance element L1 is connected via the capacitor C10 to the node between the cathode of the varactor diode VD and one end of the RFC coil L2. The anode of the varactor diode VD is grounded. The other end of the RFC coil L2 is connected to a control terminal Vc. The capacitor C10 is a DC-cutting capacitor. Accordingly, a DC control voltage input from the control terminal Vc is not applied to the base of the transistor Q3. In the oscillator device 30, the inductance element L1 and the varactor diode VD define the resonance circuit of the oscillation circuit. By changing a DC voltage applied from the control terminal Vc to the cathode of the varactor diode VD, the capacitance of the varactor diode VD is changed. Consequently, the resonance frequency of the resonance circuit is changed and eventually the oscillation frequency of the oscillator device 30 is changed. The oscillator device 30 is a voltage-controlled oscillator device. The oscillator device 30 differs from the oscillation circuit 10 only in the configuration of the resonance circuit and the basic configuration as the oscillator device is the same as that of the oscillator device 10. Thus, the oscillator devices 10 and 30 have the same operation and advantages. FIG. 10 is a circuit diagram of another preferred embodiment of the oscillator device according to the present invention. In FIG. 10, like reference numerals depict the identical or equivalent components to those in FIGS. 8 and 9 and the corresponding description is omitted. In FIG. 10, an oscillator device 40 includes the capacitor C10, the inductance element L1, the RFC coil L2, and the varactor diode VD as in the oscillator device 30 in FIG. 9, instead of the crystal oscillator X1 in the oscillator device 20 in FIG. 8. That is, the oscillator device 40 is constructed by modifying the oscillator device 20 so as to provide a voltage-controlled oscillator device which is the same as the oscillator device 30. The oscillator device 40 differs from the oscillation circuit 20 only in the configuration of the resonance circuit and the basic configuration as an oscillator device is preferably the same as that of the oscillator device 20. Thus, the oscillator devices 20 and 40 have the same operation and advantages. In each of the above-described preferred embodiments, a junction FET is preferably used as the FET. However, the type of the FET is not limited to a junction type and a MOS-FET and a MES-FET may also be used. Further, the drain and the source are arranged symmetrically relative to the gate in the FET and may be inverted. The same operation and advantages can be achieved in both cases. FIG. 11 is a perspective view showing a preferred embodiment of an electronic apparatus according to the present invention. In FIG. 11, a cellular phone 50 as an example of an electronic apparatus includes a casing 51, a printed circuit board 52 provided therein, and for example, the oscillator device 10 according to one of the preferred embodiments of the present invention mounted on the printed circuit board 52.

', '   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a voltage-controlled oscillator suitable for generation of high-frequency electromagnetic waves (high-frequency signals) such as microwaves and millimeter waves, a high-frequency module including such a voltage-controlled oscillator, and a communication apparatus including such a voltage-controlled oscillator. 2. Description of the Related Art In general, voltage controlled oscillators for high-frequency signals include a resonant circuit and an active circuit for amplifying a signal output from the resonant circuit, and the resonant circuit includes a resonator having a predetermined resonant frequency, and a variable capacitance diode connected to the resonator for shifting the resonant frequency according to a control voltage. In the related art, a voltage-controlled oscillator having a parallel connection of a variable capacitance diode and a series-connected circuit including a strip line having a length that is equal to or less than one quarter of the wavelength of the resonant frequency and a capacitor is described in, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 8-288715 and No. 2001-284962. In such a voltage-controlled oscillator of the related art, for example, the trailing end of the strip line is grounded via the low-impedance capacitor, thus allowing the overall series-connected circuit of the strip line and the capacitor to function as a dielectric circuit, in which the capacitance of the combining circuit of the variable capacitance diode and the series connected circuit varies in inverse proportion to the square of the control voltage. Since the resonant frequency is in inverse proportion to the square root (one-half power) of the capacitance of the combining circuit, the resonant frequency varies linearly with respect to the control voltage, so that the change in linear capacitance with respect to the control voltage is corrected. Typically, the resonator is connected with the variable capacitance diode using a transmission line such as a microstrip line. When observing the side of the variable capacitance diode from the resonator, the impedance of a combiner of the variable capacitance diode and the transmission line defines the resonant frequency. In the above-described device of the related art, however, the effect of the transmission line is not considered, leading to a problem that the linearity of the resonant frequency does not necessarily increase. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In order to overcome the problems described above, preferred embodiments of the present invention provide a voltage-controlled oscillator, a high-frequency module, and a communication apparatus with improved frequency linearity with respect to a control voltage even when a transmission line is disposed between a resonator and a variable capacitance diode. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a voltage-controlled oscillator includes a resonant circuit and an active circuit for amplifying a signal output from the resonant circuit, and the resonant circuit includes a resonator having a predetermined resonant frequency, and a variable capacitance diode connected to the resonator for shifting the resonant frequency according to a control voltage. In the voltage-controlled oscillator, a transmission line is connected between the resonator and the variable capacitance diode, and a capacitive circuit is connected in parallel with the variable capacitance diode. For example, without the capacitive circuit, the optimum linearity of the resonant frequency is obtained when the length of the transmission line is about one quarter (&lgr;/4) of the wavelength &lgr; of the resonant frequency, although the frequency change width is minimized. With the capacitive circuit, in contrast, the optimum linearity of the resonant frequency is obtained when the length of the transmission line is a value greater than one quarter (&lgr;/4) of the wavelength &lgr; of the resonant frequency, and the frequency change width increases. Accordingly, the linearity of the resonant frequency can be improved while maintaining the desired frequency change width. The capacitive circuit may be an open stub defined by another transmission line having one end connected between the variable capacitance diode and the transmission line and the other end which is open. By setting the length of the open stub to, for example, a value that is equal to or lower than approximately one quarter of the wavelength of the resonant frequency, a desirable capacitive circuit can be achieved. The capacitive circuit may be a capacitor connected in parallel with the variable capacitance diode. When the capacitive circuit can be a lumped circuit, e.g., when the resonant frequency is low, a single capacitor is connected in parallel, thereby readily providing a desired capacitive circuit. Preferably, the capacitive circuit has a smaller capacitance than the variable capacitance diode, and the transmission line has a length ranging from about one quarter to about one half of the wavelength of the resonant frequency of the resonant circuit. With the capacitive circuit connected in parallel with the variable capacitance diode, the optimum linearity of the resonant frequency is obtained when the length of the transmission line is a value that is greater than about one quarter (&lgr;/4) of the wavelength &lgr; of the resonant frequency. By setting the length of the transmission line to an appropriate value ranging from about one quarter (&lgr;/4) to about one half (&lgr;/2) of the wavelength &lgr; of the resonant frequency, an impedance change caused by the capacitive circuit can be compensated with the transmission line to optimize the linearity of the resonant frequency and to give a larger frequency change width than the frequency change width without the capacitive circuit. The resonator may be a dielectric resonator. The dielectric resonator provides a higher Q factor of the overall resonant circuit, resulting in a higher carrier-to-noise (C/N) ratio. However, the resonant frequency change width with respect to the control voltage tends to be low. With the transmission line connected between the resonator and the variable capacitance diode and with the capacitive circuit connected in parallel with the variable capacitance diode, the resonant frequency change width can increase while maintaining the desired frequency linearity. Therefore, the linearity of the resonant frequency, the frequency change width, and the C/N ratio can be improved simultaneously.

In another aspect of the present invention, a communication apparatus includes the voltage-controlled oscillator according to preferred embodiments of the present invention described above.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS A voltage-controlled oscillator, a high-frequency module, and a communication apparatus according to preferred embodiments of the present invention are described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings. FIG. 1 shows a voltage-controlled oscillator according to a first preferred embodiment of the present invention. In FIG. 1, an active circuit 1 is connected with a resonant circuit 2, and includes, for example, a field-effect transistor which is an electronic component, and so on. The active circuit 1 amplifies a signal output from the resonant circuit 2. The resonant circuit 2 outputs a high-frequency signal having a frequency according to a control voltage Vc to the active circuit 1. The resonant circuit 2 includes a resonator 3, a variable capacitance diode 4, a transmission line 5, and a capacitive circuit 6. The resonator 3 has a predetermined resonant frequency A, and includes, for example, a microstrip line, a dielectric resonator, or other suitable element. One end of the resonator 3, which defines the output side, is connected with the active circuit 1. The variable capacitance diode 4 is connected with the other end of the resonator 3 via the transmission line 5. The variable capacitance diode 4, which may be a varactor diode, a varicap diode, or other suitable element, has a cathode connected with the transmission line 5, and an anode that is grounded. A variable capacitance Cv of the variable capacitance diode 4 varies according to the control voltage applied to the cathode thereof, thus causing the resonant frequency &ohgr; of the resonator 3 to be shifted to the resonant frequency &ohgr;0. The capacitance Cv of the variable capacitance diode 4 is preferably set to a value ranging from, for example, about 2 pF to about 0.3 pF (Cv&equals;2 pF to 0.3 pF). The transmission line 5 is connected between the resonator 3 and the variable capacitance diode 4, and may be a strip line, a microstrip line, a slot line, or other suitable element. The transmission line 5 preferably has a length L close to, for example, about one quarter of the wavelength &lgr; of the resonant frequency &ohgr;0, ranging from about one quarter to about one half of the wavelength &lgr;, i.e., &lgr;/4<L<&lgr;/2. The capacitive circuit 6 is connected in parallel with the variable capacitance diode 4, and may be an open stub, a capacitor, or other suitable element. The capacitive circuit 6 has a constant capacitance Cc, and the capacitance Cc of the capacitive circuit 6 is preferably set to a value smaller than the capacitance Cv of the variable capacitance diode 4. Given the capacitance Cv of the variable capacitance diode 4 set to a value ranging from, for example, about 2 pF to about 0.3 pF (Cv&equals;2 pF to 0.3 pF), the capacitance Cc of the capacitive circuit 6 is set to a value ranging from about 0.005 pF to about 0.1 pF (Cc&equals;0.005 pF to 0.1 pF). In the voltage-controlled oscillator with the above-described structure according to the first preferred embodiment, the operation of the transmission line 5 and the capacitive circuit 6 is described below. Without the capacitive circuit 6, impedance Zv of the variable capacitance diode 4 as observed from a point P between the resonator 3 and the transmission line 5 is given by Eq. (1)            Z V  =   Z L  &it;    j &it;    &it;  0C V  &it;  R C   + 1 +  j &it;    &it;  &it;    &it; 0 &it;  C V  &it;  Z L  &it; tanh &it;  {   (   +  j &it;    &it;    )  &it; L  }      j &it;    &it;  0C V  &it;  Z L   +   (   j &it;    &it;  &it;    &it; 0 &it;    &it;  C V  &it;  R C   + 1  )  &it; tanh &it;  {   (   +  j &it;    &it;    )  &it; L  }          Eq .    &it;  ( 1 )            where ZL denotes the characteristic impedance of the transmission line 5, &ohgr;0 denotes the resonant frequency of the resonant circuit 2, Rc denotes loss of the variable capacitance diode 4, &agr; denotes the attenuation coefficient, and &bgr; denotes the phase coefficient. When the term of Eq. (1) which affects the frequency change is calculated, then the impedance Zv corresponds to a reactance              &it;   Z V  =   j &it;    &it;  Z L  &it;     &it;    &it; 0 &it;  C V  &it;  Z L  &it; tan &it;    &it;  &it;    &it; L  - 1     &it;    &it; 0 &it;  C V  &it;  Z L   +  tan &it;    &it;  &it;    &it; L     =  jX V        Eq .    &it;  ( 2 )            As is apparent from Eq. (2), the frequency change is defined by both the capacitance Cv of the variable capacitance diode 4 and the length L of the transmission line 5. Then, the frequency linearity A and the frequency change width B when the length L of the transmission line 5 changes is calculated using Eq. (2). The resulting frequency linearity A and frequency change width B are indicated by characteristic lines 7 and 8 shown in FIG. 2, respectively, where the applied control voltage ranges from about 3 V to about 9 V. The frequency linearity A is given by, for example, the following equation:           LinearityA =      &PartialD;  f &af;  (   V C  &it; 2  )      &PartialD;  V C   &it; 0   -   &PartialD;  f &af;  (   V C  &it; 1  )      &PartialD;  V C   &it; 0      &PartialD;  f &af;  (   V C  &it; 2  )      &PartialD;  V C   &it; 0     100      Eq .    &it;  ( 3 )            where f(Vc) represents a function indicating the resonant frequency when the control voltage Vc is applied, and Vc0, Vc1, and Vc2 indicate control voltages, such that Vc0&equals;6 V, Vc1&equals;3 V, and Vc2&equals;9 V. As is indicated by the characteristic line 7 shown in FIG. 2, the frequency linearity A greatly changes depending upon the length L of the transmission line 5, and the optimum linearity A (0%) is obtained when the length L of the transmission line 5 is set to length L1 of about one quarter (&lgr;/4) of the wavelength &lgr; of the resonant frequency &ohgr;0. The capacitance Cv of the variable capacitance diode 4 is substantially in inverse proportion to the control voltage Vc, as indicated by a characteristic line 9 shown in FIG. 3. As is indicated by the characteristic line 8 shown in FIG. 2, the frequency change width B has substantially the minimum value B1 when the length L of the transmission line 5 is preferably set to the length L1. Specifically, when the length L of the transmission line 5 is set to about a quarter-wavelength, the impedance of the tangent term of Equation (2) is high, resulting in the maximum impedance Zv (jXv) of the variable capacitance diode 4 as observed from the point P shown in FIG. 1. This causes a small change of the impedance Zv as the capacitance Cv of the variable capacitance diode 4 changes, so that the frequency change width B is minimized. In a voltage-controlled oscillator which is configured such that the resonator 3 and the variable capacitance diode 4 are connected with each other using the transmission line 5, the length L of the transmission line 5 can be set as desired to increase the frequency linearity A, although the frequency change width B is low. In the voltage-controlled oscillator of the first preferred embodiment, on the other hand, the capacitive circuit 6 and the variable capacitance diode 4 are connected in parallel with each other. The combined capacitance Ct of the variable capacitance diode 4 and the capacitive circuit 6 is obtained by summing the capacitance Cv of the variable capacitance diode 4 and the capacitance Cc of the capacitive circuit 6, i.e., Ct&equals;Cv&plus;Cc. A characteristic line 10 shown in FIG. 3 indicating the combined capacitance Ct is deviated from the characteristic line 9 inversely proportional to the control voltage Vc. The frequency linearity A of the voltage-controlled oscillator of the first preferred embodiment with respect to a change of the length L of the transmission line 5 is calculated using Equation (2), in which the capacitance Cv is replaced with the combined capacitance Ct. The resulting frequency linearity A is indicated by a characteristic line 11 shown in FIG. 2. As is indicated by the characteristic line 11 shown in FIG. 2, the length L of the transmission line 5 with respect to the optimum linearity A (0%) is shifted to length L2 from the length L1 indicated by the characteristic line 7 exhibited by the voltage-controlled oscillator without the capacitive circuit 6. Specifically, the linearity A indicated by the characteristic line 11 exhibited by the voltage-controlled oscillator with the capacitive circuit 6 is generally shifted toward the positive (plus) side with respect to the linearity A indicated by the characteristic line 7 exhibited by the voltage-controlled oscillator without the capacitive circuit 6. As the length L of the transmission line 5 increases, however, the linearity A changes toward the negative (minus) side. As a result, the positively shifted portion of the linearity A caused by the capacitive circuit 6 is compensated with the transmission line 5, and is cancelled when the length L is set to the length L2, resulting in the optimum linearity A (0%). In the voltage-controlled oscillator with the capacitive circuit 6, the frequency change width B is also low and exhibits a characteristic line substantially similar to the characteristic line 8. Specifically, since the tangent term of Eq. (2) relating to the length L of the transmission line 5 more greatly changes depending upon the length L than the combined capacitance Ct, the frequency change width B is more affected by the length L of the transmission line 5 than by replacing the capacitance Cv of the variable capacitance diode 4 with the combined capacitance Ct. As indicated by the characteristic line 8 shown in FIG. 2, when the length L of the transmission line 5 is set to the length L2, the frequency change width B has a value B2 higher than the value B1 when the length L is set to the length L1. In the first preferred embodiment, therefore, the capacitive circuit 6 and the variable capacitance diode 4 are connected in parallel with each other, and the length L of the transmission line 5 which connects the resonator 3 to the variable capacitance diode 4 is set as desired, thereby increasing the frequency change width B and the frequency linearity A. Since the transmission line 5 with a desired length L is used to connect the resonator 3 and the variable capacitance diode 4, the frequency linearity A can be improved, unlike the voltage-controlled oscillator of the related art in which the frequency linearity A is reduced due to the effect of the transmission line 5. In the first preferred embodiment, since the capacitance Cc of the capacitive circuit 6 is set to a value smaller than the capacitance Cv of the variable capacitance diode 4, and the length L of the transmission line 5 is set to a value ranging from about one quarter to about one half of the wavelength &lgr; of the resonant frequency &ohgr;0, the change in impedance Zv caused by the capacitive circuit 6 can be compensated with the transmission line 5. Thus, the optimum frequency linearity A can be obtained, and a larger frequency change width B than that of the voltage-controlled oscillator without the capacitive circuit 6 can also be obtained. In the first preferred embodiment, the length L of the transmission line 5 is set to a value ranging from about one quarter to about one half of the wavelength &lgr; of the resonant frequency &ohgr;0, i.e., &lgr;/4<L<&lgr;/2. As is given by Eq. (2), the impedance Zv periodically changes with respect to the length L of the transmission line 5, and the length L of the transmission line 5 may be therefore set to a value of (2n&boxH;1)&lgr;/4<L<(n&plus;1) &lgr;/2, where n indicates an integer. FIG. 4 shows a voltage-controlled oscillator according to a second preferred embodiment of the present invention. In the second preferred embodiment, an open stub 21 defined by another transmission line with the open trailing end is used for the capacitive circuit 6 of the first preferred embodiment. In the second preferred embodiment, the same components as those of the first preferred embodiment are designated by the same reference numerals, and a description thereof is omitted. The open stub 21 defines a capacitive circuit, and includes, for example, a strip line, a microstrip line, a slot line, or other suitable element, like the transmission line 5. The open stub 21 has one end connected between the variable capacitance diode 4 and the transmission line 5, and the other end which is open. A length L3 of the open stub 21 is preferably set to a value that is equal to or less than, for example, about one quarter of the wavelength &lgr; of the resonant frequency &ohgr;0, i.e., 0<L3&lE;&lgr;/4, so that the open stub 21 is capacitive. The open stub 21 is periodically capacitive and dielectric in an alternate manner as the length L3 of the open stub 21 increases. Therefore, the length L3 of the open stub 21 may be set to a value of n&lgr;/2<L3&lE;(2n&plus;1)&lgr;/4, where &lgr; denotes the wavelength of the resonant frequency &ohgr;0 and n indicates an integer. Accordingly, similar advantages achieved by the first preferred embodiment can also be achieved by the second preferred embodiment. In the second preferred embodiment, since the open stub 21 defined by a strip line or other suitable element defines a capacitive circuit, the open stub 21 can be disposed on a substrate or the like together with the transmission line 5. It is not necessary to assemble parts, unlike a capacitive circuit defined by a capacitor or the like, thus increasing the productivity. For example, when the resonant frequency &ohgr;0 is relatively low, as a modification shown in FIG. 5, the capacitive circuit according to preferred embodiments of the present invention may be a capacitor 22. In this modification, the capacitor 22 is connected in parallel with the variable capacitance diode 4, and one end of the capacitor 22 is connected between the variable capacitance diode 4 and the transmission line 5 while the other end is grounded. FIG. 6 shows a voltage-controlled oscillator according to a third preferred embodiment of the present invention. In the third preferred embodiment, a dielectric resonator 31 is preferably provided in place of the resonator 3 of the first preferred embodiment. In the third preferred embodiment, the same components as those of the first preferred embodiment are designated by the same reference numerals, and a description thereof is omitted. The dielectric resonator 31 is preferably formed of, for example, a TE010-mode resonator resonated at a TE010 mode, or a TE01&dgr;-mode resonator resonated at a TE01&dgr; mode. The dielectric resonator 31 includes facing electrodes disposed on both surfaces of a substrate, each electrode having a substantially round opening 31A, as shown in, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 11-239021. The opening 31A is provided with parallel coupling lines 31B and 31C including microstrip lines or other suitable elements. The coupling line 31B has an end connected to the active circuit 1 and the other end grounded via a terminating resistor 32. The coupling line 31C has an open end and the other end connected to the transmission line 5. Accordingly, similar advantages to those of the first preferred embodiment can also be achieved by the third preferred embodiment. Furthermore, the resonant circuit 2 of the third preferred embodiment which includes a resonator defined by the dielectric resonator 31 can have a higher Q factor than a resonant circuit which includes a resonator defined by, for example, a quarter-wavelength microstrip line. In general, as the Q factor of the resonant circuit 2 increases, the carrier-to-noise (C/N) ratio also increases. However, the frequency change width with respect to the control voltage Vc tends to be low. In the third preferred embodiment, however, the length L of the transmission line 5 can be adjusted to greatly increase the frequency change width as well as the frequency linearity because of connection of the capacitive circuit 6. Therefore, the frequency change width can be increased, and the C/N ratio can also be increased while maintaining the frequency linearity. FIG. 7 shows a communication apparatus 41 according to a fourth preferred embodiment of the present invention. In the fourth preferred embodiment, the communication apparatus, particularly, a high-frequency module, includes the voltage-controlled oscillator. The communication apparatus 41 according to the fourth preferred embodiment includes, for example, a signal processing circuit 42, a high-frequency module 43 connected to the signal processing circuit 42 for outputting or inputting a high-frequency signal, and an antenna 45 connected to the high-frequency module 43 for transmitting or receiving a high-frequency signal via an antenna duplexer 44. The high-frequency module 43 includes a transmitter connected between the output side of the signal processing circuit 42 and the antenna duplexer 44, and a receiver connected between the antenna duplexer 44 and the input side of the signal processing circuit 42. The transmitter includes a band-pass filter 46, an amplifier 47, a mixer 48, a band-pass filter 49, and a power amplifier 50, and the receiver includes a band-pass filter 51, a low-noise amplifier 52, a mixer 53, a band-pass filter 54, and an amplifier 55. A voltage-controlled oscillator 56 according to any one of the first through third preferred embodiments is connected to the mixers 48 and 53. The operation of the communication apparatus of the fourth preferred embodiment with the above-described structure is now described. For transmission, an intermediate-frequency signal (IF signal) output from the signal processing circuit 42 is passed to the band-pass filter 46 where an unwanted signal is removed therefrom, and the resulting IF signal is then amplified by the amplifier 47 and input to the mixer 48. The mixer 48 multiplies the IF signal by a carrier wave from the voltage-controlled oscillator 56 so as to be up-converted into a high-frequency signal (RF signal). The RF signal output from the mixer 48 is passed to the band-pass filter 49 where an unwanted signal is removed therefrom, and the resulting signal is amplified to transmission power by the power amplifier 50, which is then transmitted from the antenna 45 via the antenna duplexer 44. For reception, an RF signal received by the antenna 45 is input to the band-pass filter 51 via the antenna duplexer 44. An unwanted signal is removed from the RF signal by the band-pass filter 51, and the resulting RF signal is then amplified by the low-noise amplifier 52 and input to the mixer 53. The mixer 53 multiples the RF signal by a carrier wave from the voltage-controlled oscillator 56 so as to be down-converted into an IF signal. The IF signal output from the mixer 53 is passed to the band-pass filter 54 where an unwanted signal is removed therefrom, and the resulting IF signal is amplified by the amplifier 55 and input to the signal processing circuit 42. In the fourth preferred embodiment, therefore, the communication apparatus 41 includes the voltage-controlled oscillator 56 which increases the frequency change width while maintaining the frequency linearity, thus achieving a broader modulation bandwidth of the communication apparatus 41. In the fourth preferred embodiment, a high-frequency oscillation circuit according to the present invention is applied to a communication apparatus, but may also be applied to, for example, a radar apparatus, and so on.

      "('06836192', '20041228', 'B1', '', 'Methods and apparatuses for tuning voltage controlled oscillators', ' A method and apparatus for tuning a VCO circuit to provide desired modulations is described. In one embodiment, the method of the present invention uses a controlled voltage from a digital-to-analog converter to obtain VCO voltage/frequency characteristics. The VCO voltage/frequency characteristics are used to determine a VCO capacitance value as well as a charge pump current level for each frequency band of interest. For one embodiment, the VCO circuit includes a bank of switchable capacitors used to set the VCO capacitance value. The charge pump includes a number of switch-controlled current meters to set the charge pump current level. The VCO capacitors and charge pump current meters are controlled by an off-chip CPU. ', '   FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to digital wireless communication, and more specifically to frequency modulation using a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The proliferation of digital wireless communication systems has led to a need for reliable modulation circuitry. Phase-locked loop (PLL) circuits are attractive in modulation applications due to their combination of controllable modulation and stable so and adjustable carrier frequency. As known in the art, a VCO can be used to effect Gaussian-shaped Continuous Phase Binary Frequency Shift Keying Modulation (GCPBFSK) in which the modulating wave shifts the output frequencies, away from the center frequency, by an amount between predetermined values. The predetermined values, i.e., two different frequencies representing zero and one, are called modulation deviation and are denoted by f0 and f1 respectively. The frequencies, f0 and f1 are typically equal. For example, for a wireless standard having 79 channels in a frequency range of 2402 MHz-2480 MHz with each channel separated by 1 MHz, the center frequencies may be equal to 2402 MHz&plus;nMHz (n&equals;0 to 78). The f0 may range within some negative values (e.g., from 140 KHz to 175 Khz) and f1 may range within a corresponding positive values (e.g. from 140 KHz to 175 KHz), in respect to the center frequency. In order to keep frequencies f0 and f1 within their specific range, the voltage to the VCO must be controlled very carefully. Typical VCO gain (KVCO) may be on the order of 110 MHz/V-200 MHz/V. Typical VCOs may be operated from 0.6 v to 2.2 v, but actually only the linear range (1.0 v-1.8 v) can be used for this application, otherwise non-linear distortion will result. For a wide frequency range (2402 MHz-2480 MHz), it is difficult to maintain a linear frequency response. The oscillation frequency of a VCO circuit is inversely proportional to the square root of the product of the inductance and capacitance (LC). It is possible to divide a large frequency range into segments to obtain a piecewise linear response over each segment. This can be achieved by using a set of switch-able capacitors, varactors (whose capacitance is voltage-controllable) and inductors. Often a larger frequency range is divided to account for the tolerance values of integrated capacitors and inductors that may run as high as 30%. Each segment is then covered by a specific capacitor&apos;s combination. The voltage-frequency characteristics of a VCO vary from chip to chip. Therefore to obtain the appropriate modulation characteristics, the voltage to the VCO must be controlled depending on the characteristics of the chip. A typical PLL circuit in accordance with the prior art includes a charge pump, which acts as a current source. The charge pump consists of a set of current sources. The appropriate current source is chosen, based on the VCO voltage-frequency characteristics, to charge the capacitors of the LPF and thus controls the voltage to the VCO. The difficulty arises in determining the VCO capacitance value (i.e. the capacitors&apos; combination) and charge pump current value to provide the desired modulation deviation for each channel. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A method for setting the VCO circuit capacitance value and charge pump current level is described. To set the capacitance value, the operation frequency range is divided into a plurality of frequency bands. Then the frequency of a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) for each combination of capacitance values and lowest/highest control voltage levels is measured. A capacitance value for each frequency band is then selected such that the frequency band is between the lowest frequency (corresponding to the lowest voltage level) and highest frequency (corresponding to the highest control voltage). To set the charge pump current level, a representative frequency is determined for each frequency band. Then VCO gain at the representative frequency is estimated and the charge pump current level for each frequency band is selected based upon the estimated VCO gain. Other features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the accompanying drawings, and from the detailed description, that follows below.     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The present invention is illustrated by way of example, and not limitation, by the figures of the accompanying drawings in which like references indicate similar elements and in which; FIG. 1 illustrates a typical PLL circuit in accordance with the present invention; FIG. 2 illustrates a VCO circuit in accordance with the present invention; FIG. 3 is a process flow diagram in accordance with the present invention; FIG. 4 illustrates, graphically, exemplary voltage frequency measurements in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention; and FIG. 5 illustrates a system block diagram in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.     DETAILED DESCRIPTION A method and apparatus for tuning a VCO is described. An embodiment of the invention provides a method that determines the VCO variable capacitance value and the charge pump current level to provide desired modulation characteristics within a specified band. In the following detailed description of the present invention, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form, rather than in detail, in order to avoid obscuring the present invention. FIG. 1 illustrates a typical PLL circuit in accordance with the present invention. The PLL circuit 100, shown in FIG. 1, includes a charge pump 110, fed by a current source 135. The current into the charge pump 110 determines how much current is pumped into the low pass filter (LPF) 115. This current charges the capacitors of the LPF 115 and thus controls the voltage to the VCO. For one embodiment of the present invention the current source 135 has a number of switch-controlled current meters, not shown, that control the amount of current. Each switch may contribute current in varying amounts to provide 16 current levels. The current, which may be controlled from the CPU of a baseband chip, not shown, changes the increment/decrement of the voltage coming out of the LPF 115. The adjustable current allows varying the voltage at the voltage control layer to obtain the desired modulation For example, the frequency of a channel may be 2402 MHz&plus;/160 Khz that corresponds to V0&plus;/&Dgr;V. The charge pump current controls the &Dgr;V. The current switches may be set to provide the desired output. To determine the current level required the VCO characteristics must first be determined. FIG. 2 illustrates, in greater detail, the VCO 120 of FIG. 1. VCO 120 includes four capacitors C0-C3. Each capacitor has a switch D0-D3 that allows the capacitor to be turned on or off. The capacitors are directly controlled by the CPU of a baseband chip, not shown, that sets switches D0-D3. The four binary switches allow for 16 values of capacitance. The 16 values of capacitance may be chosen so that their values cover a range of frequencies much broader than the range of interest. For example, for the 16 capacitance values may cover a frequency range of 2200 MHz to 2600 MHz for a system utilizing a frequency range of 2402 MHz to 2480 MHz. This is done to account for the tolerance values of the passive components. In order to accurately measure the VCO characteristics, the voltage source must be very well controlled. For one embodiment, voltage to the VCO 120 from the LPF 115 is cut and replaced with a control voltage from a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) 130. This is done to prevent any voltage variance from the LPF that may affect the measurement of VCO characteristics. The DAC provides voltage that is proportional to a digital input value. The DAC may thus provide voltages in uniform increments over a known linear range. For one embodiment the DAC may provide seven voltages, V1-V7, ranging from approximately 1.0 V to approximately 1.75 V in increments of approximately 0.125 V. FIG. 3 is a process flow diagram in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The process 300, shown in FIG. 3, begins at operation 305 in which the voltage/frequency characteristics of the VCO are measured for a number of capacitance value/voltage level combinations. The frequency is measured for each of the 16 capacitance values at a number of controlled voltage levels (e.g., 7 levels) provided by the DAC. The measurement may be made at another chip where a CPU and a frequency counter reside. For example, the capacitance may be set to C0 and then a counter located on the baseband chip measures the frequency for voltages V1-V7. FIG. 4 illustrates, graphically, exemplary voltage frequency measurements in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. As shown in FIG. 4, graph 405 may indicate the measured frequencies for capacitance equal to C0. Graph 410 and 415 may indicate the measured frequencies for capacitance equal to C1 and C2, respectively, continuing to C15 illustrated by graph 420. Of course the graphs are not continuous, but constructed from the seven discrete frequency/voltage points. For each of the 16 levels of capacitance, the frequency/voltage characteristics of the VCO will be different. At operation 310, the results of the frequency measurements are compared to desired frequency bands, or frequencies of interest. For an embodiment in which the range of capacitor values corresponds to a frequency range greater than the range of interest, an initial determination may be made to determine a capacitance value that covers the frequency range of interest. The covered frequency range for each capacitance value is measured with two specific DAC values (e.g., V1 corresponds to the lowest frequency and V7 corresponds to the highest frequency). This process may be illustrated with a simple example. The frequency range of interest is denoted by &lsqb;Fx, Fy&rsqb; where Fx/ Fy is the lowest/highest frequency of the frequency band of interest. The capacitance value is chosen so that it covers the frequency range of interest, i.e. &lsqb;Fx, Fy&rsqb;. This process is repeated for other frequency bands of interest. For example, a system using frequencies 2402 MHz to 2480 MHz may be partitioned into six bands each covering approximately 13 MHz. Once the appropriate capacitance value has been determined, the appropriate charge pump current may be determined by using the frequency/voltage characteristics of the VCO for the given capacitance. In a PLL circuit, the slope, S, of the VCO frequency/voltage characteristics multiplied by the current, I, should equal a constant (e.g., 14,000). Because SI&equals;14,000, the slope can be used to determine the appropriate current value. The targeted constant (e.g. 14000 as shown in the above) is normally determined by the digital controlled modulation waveform, which controls the divider ratio and is not shown in the FIG. 1. At operation 315, a representative frequency is determined for each of the six bands. The representative frequency represents the band in terms of slope. Some wireless specifications allow for at most 10% variance in the slope, so the representative frequency must be determined accurately. For one embodiment this frequency may be obtained from the direct measurement of a number of VCO circuit chips. For one embodiment several hundred chips are tested to determine the representative frequency. The representative frequencies, determined through testing, are then applied to all chips. At operation 320 the VCO gain (frequency-voltage slope) is estimated at the representative frequency. For one embodiment the slope is estimated through a 3rd order polynomial interpolation of selected points around the representative frequency. In an alternative embodiment the slope may be estimated through a second order interpolation. Once the slope has been estimated the appropriate charge pump current level is determined. In one embodiment a mapping table may be used to obtain the charge pump current level corresponding to the estimated slope. Thus, the method of one embodiment of the present invention allows an appropriate VCO capacitance level and charge pump current level to be determined for each frequency band of interest. At operation 325, the VCO capacitance value and charge pump current level is set to determined values. The operations of determining and setting the VCO capacitance value and charge pump current level in accordance with the present invention may be implemented by hardware and/or software contained within a baseband chip.

      "('06836193', '20041228', 'B1', '', 'Discretely variable capacitor for voltage controlled oscillator tuning', ' A system and method are disclosed for generating a variable frequency output. A voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) is used. The VCO comprises a plurality of aggregate capacitor circuits, wherein each of the aggregate capacitor circuits has a collective capacitance, at least two of the collective capacitances have different values, and each of the aggregate capacitor circuits includes one or more individual capacitors wherein each of the individual capacitors are substantially the same size. The VCO further comprises a plurality of switches configured to select one or more aggregate capacitor circuits from among the plurality of aggregate capacitor circuits to form a discretely variable capacitor network having a discretely variable capacitance, wherein the discretely variable capacitor network is configured to cause an oscillator to generate a variable frequency as a result of the discretely variable capacitance. ', '   FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to voltage controlled oscillators (VCO&apos;s). More specifically, a VCO that includes a discretely variable capacitance circuit in its oscillator is disclosed. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Frequency synthesizers are widely used in modern communication systems, particularly wireless communication systems, to generate desired frequencies for modulation and demodulation. Many of the wireless protocols, for instance GSM or CDMA, support multiple frequency channels. Thus, the wireless devices used in systems supporting these protocols should be capable of transmitting and receiving signals at multiple frequencies, and the frequency synthesizers used in the wireless devices should be configurable to generate different frequencies. Generally, a frequency synthesizer generates different frequencies by adjusting the oscillation frequency of its oscillator. Frequency synthesizers that require low phase noise and high quality of oscillation commonly employ LC tank oscillators with variable capacitors. Common variable capacitor designs often include a discretely variable capacitor for coarsely and quickly adjusting the capacitance to a desired range, and a continuously variable capacitor for fine tuning the capacitance. Most of the existing implementations of the discretely variable capacitor fall into two categories: ones that switch among capacitors of the same size, and ones that use non-uniformly sized capacitors in a switching network. Uniformly sized capacitor designs have the disadvantage of requiring a large number of capacitors and hence a large number switches to provide a desired amount of variance in capacitance. The number of capacitors and switches can be reduced by using nonuniformly sized capacitors. Ideally, capacitor size would increase by a multiplier of 2, (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.) to require a minimum number of capacitors and switches. However, such a different sized capacitor design tends to suffer from differential non-linearity (DNL) problems caused during the manufacturing process. One approach that has been suggested to best deal with the issues described above is to use capacitors that increase in size, but not as aggressively as by powers of 2. Such a mixed radix or multiplier design is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,233,441 by Welland. This approach is a compromise that reduces the number of switches required by a one size capacitor design while reducing somewhat the introduced nonlinearities. However, nonlinearities are still introduced and switching is not minimized. It would be desirable if to develop a design that could further reduce the number of switches and avoid nonlinearities.     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The present invention will be readily understood by the following detailed description in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate like structural elements, and in which: FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a frequency synthesizer used in wireless communication systems, incorporating a VCO designed in accordance with the present invention. FIG. 2 is a circuit diagram illustrating a typical implementation of a discretely variable capacitor. FIG. 3 is a circuit diagram illustrating a discretely variable capacitor embodiment according to the present invention.     DETAILED DESCRIPTION It should be appreciated that the present invention can be implemented in numerous ways, including as a process., an apparatus, a system, or a computer readable medium such as a computer readable storage medium or a computer network wherein program instructions are sent over optical or electronic communication links. It should be noted that the order of the steps of disclosed processes may be altered within the scope of the invention. A detailed description of one or more preferred embodiments of the invention is provided below along with accompanying figures that illustrate by way of example the principles of the invention. While the invention is described in connection with such embodiments, it should be understood that the invention is not limited to any embodiment. On the contrary, the scope of the invention is limited only by the appended claims and the invention encompasses numerous alternatives, modifications and equivalents. For the purpose of example, numerous specific details are set forth in the following description in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. The present invention may be practiced according to the claims without some or all of these specific details. For the purpose of clarity, technical material that is known in the technical fields related to the invention has not been described in detail so that the present invention is not unnecessarily obscured. An improved frequency synthesizer design is disclosed. The design uses a discretely variable capacitor using switchable capacitor networks that have capacitors of the same size to adjust the oscillator frequency and produce different frequency outputs. FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a frequency synthesizer used in wireless communication systems, incorporating a VCO designed in accordance with the present invention. A reference frequency input from reference frequency source 100 is sent to phase locked loop (PLL) 102. The PLL includes an R counter 105, a phase frequency detector 115, a charge pump 120, a loop filter 125, an N counter 130 and a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) 140. Although an integer N PLL is shown for the purpose of illustration, fractional N PLLs and other types of PLLs are used in other embodiments. The disclosed tuning capacitor network is also used in other frequency synthesizers including direct modulation designs. The disclosed network is generally useful in any VCO or frequency synthesizer design that includes a tunable oscillator. The PLL is essentially a feedback control system that controls the input of VCO 140. When the PLL enters its locked state, a stable voltage is applied to the VCO so that the VCO oscillates at a desired frequency. Due to the phase noise requirements of the frequency synthesizer, an oscillator with high quality factor (Q), typically an LC tank oscillator, is used in the VCO. For the purposes of this example, the details of VCO 140 are not shown except for LC tank oscillator 104. The LC tank oscillator has a resonate frequency fr that equals         1  2 &it;  &it;  LC    ,        where L is the inductance and C is the capacitance. To make the resonate frequency adjustable, generally the oscillator is implemented with a fixed inductance and a variable capacitance. In FIG. 1, LC tank 140 includes: an inductor 106 with a fixed inductance; a fixed capacitor 108 with a fixed capacitance CF; a discretely variable capacitor 110 having a capacitance CD that is adjustable to a discrete number of capacitance levels, used to quickly adjust the capacitance close to a desired value; and an optional continuously variable capacitor 112 having a capacitance Cc that is used to fine tune the capacitance until it reaches a desired level. FIG. 2 is a circuit diagram illustrating a typical implementation of a discretely variable capacitor. Capacitor 200 comprises a capacitance network with a total of N capacitors connected in parallel, between terminal 220 and 222. Capacitor 202 has a capacitance of C1, and is coupled with a switch 210 that controls whether capacitor 202 is connected between the two terminals of the network. When the capacitor is connected to the network, its capacitance is added to the overall capacitance of the variable capacitor. Similarly, capacitors 204, 206, 208 and others are coupled with switches 212, 214, 216, etc., and the switches control whether a capacitor is connected to the capacitor network and whether its capacitance contributes to the overall capacitance of the circuit. In this configuration, the sum of the capacitance of the connected capacitors is the overall capacitance of the variable capacitor. In some implementations, the capacitors in the capacitance network have the same capacitance value. A number of capacitors are switched on to produce the desired sum. In such implementations, the capacitance of each capacitor is set to a relatively small unit value. Thus, to obtain a desired capacitance that is relatively large, a large number of capacitors need to be switched on. As described above, different size capacitors may be used in the capacitance network so that connecting different switches connected to different sized capacitors may add a larger or smaller amount of capacitance to the network, decreasing the number of switches and capacitors required. This method, however, results in manufacturing problems involving differential nonlinearity. FIG. 3 is a circuit diagram illustrating a discretely variable capacitor embodiment according to the present invention. Between two terminals 360 and 362 are a number of aggregate capacitor circuits 302, 304, 306, 308. Aggregate capacitor circuit, for example 304, has a capacitor network 350 that includes capacitors 320 and 322, and a switch 312 that is used to select the capacitor network. The switch can be implemented in a variety of ways, for instance using a transistor, as it is well known to those skilled in the art. Similarly, aggregate capacitor circuits 306 and 308 have corresponding capacitor networks 352 and 354, as well as switches 314 and 316. In other embodiments, the number of aggregate capacitor circuits and the number of capacitors in the capacitor networks vary. In some embodiments, the aggregate capacitor circuit associated with a switch has a different collective capacitance value than the other aggregate capacitor circuits associated with other switches. In one embodiment, the aggregate capacitance values increase using a multiplier of 2, (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.) so that a minimum number of switches is required to select a desired overall capacitance value between terminals 360 and 362. The individual capacitors used in each of the aggregate capacitor circuits, on the other hand, each are the same size or substantially the same size so that differential nonlinearities are not caused by the manufacturing process. For purposes of this specification, capacitors are considered substantially the same size if significant differential nonlinearities do not result when the capacitors are manufactured. Thus, whether capacitors are substantially the same size for the purpose of a given application depends on the manufacturing process and the impact of nonlinearities on the application. In the embodiment shown, if n represents the number of capacitors in an aggregate capacitor circuit and C represents the capacitance of one capacitor, then the capacitance of the network is calculated to be nC. When the switch associated with the capacitor network is closed, the capacitor network is connected to the rest of the circuit and its capacitance is added to the overall discrete capacitance between nodes 360 and 362. The number of capacitors in each aggregate capacitor circuit varies in different embodiments. As described above, in one embodiment, the number of capacitors in each aggregate capacitor circuit increase by a multiplier of 2, thus minimizing the number of switches required. Other ratios are used in other embodiments, and in some embodiments, there is more than one ratio used. To tune the oscillator, the required combination of switches are selected and closed in the capacitor network. For example, in an embodiment shown in FIG. 3, if the capacitance of aggregate capacitor circuits 302, 304, 306 and 308 are C, 2C, 4C and 8C, then, to obtain a capacitance of 10C, switches 312 and 316 are connected and aggregate capacitor circuits 304 and 308 are added to the overall capacitance. A discretely variable capacitor network for use in a frequency synthesizer has been described. The capacitor network includes capacitors that are the same size or substantially the same size. The capacitor network includes aggregate capacitor circuits that include different numbers of capacitors. Each aggregate capacitor circuit is associated with a switch. The number of switches required to select a given capacitance is reduced by choosing the aggregate capacitor circuits to have different collective capacitances. Although the foregoing invention has been described in some detail for purposes of clarity of understanding, it will be apparent that certain changes and modifications may be practiced within the scope of the appended claims. It should be noted that there are many alternative ways of implementing both the process and apparatus of the present invention. Accordingly, the present embodiments are to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive, and the invention is not to be limited to the details given herein, but may be modified within the scope and equivalents of the appended claims.

', '   CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority to U.S. provisional Application No. 60/341,876, filed Dec. 21, 2001, which is incorporated herein by reference.     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to electronic switches. More specifically, the present invention relates to using latching micro-magnetic switches to connect circuits, such as attenuators, capacitors, phase array antenna devices, or the like, to a circuit or signal path. 2. Background Art Switches are typically electrically controlled two-state devices that open and close contacts to effect operation of devices in an electrical or optical circuit. Relays, for example, typically function as switches that activate or de-activate portions of electrical, optical or other devices. Relays are commonly used in many applications including telecommunications, radio frequency (RF) communications, portable electronics, consumer and industrial electronics, aerospace, and other systems. More recently, optical switches (also referred to as optical relays or simply relays herein) have been used to switch optical signals (such as those in optical communication systems) from one path to another. Although the earliest relays were mechanical or solid-state devices, recent developments in micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technologies and microelectronics manufacturing have made micro-electrostatic and micro-magnetic relays possible. Such micro-magnetic relays typically include an electromagnet that energizes an armature to make or break an electrical contact. When the magnet is de-energized, a spring or other mechanical force typically restores the armature to a quiescent position. Such relays typically exhibit a number of marked disadvantages, however, in that they generally exhibit only a single stable output (i.e., the quiescent state) and they are not latching (i.e., they do not retain a constant output as power is removed from the relay). Moreover, the spring required by conventional micro-magnetic relays may degrade or break over time. Non-latching micro-magnetic relays are known. The relay includes a permanent magnet and an electromagnet for generating a magnetic field that intermittently opposes the field generated by the permanent magnet. The relay must consume power in the electromagnet to maintain at least one of the output states. Moreover, the power required to generate the opposing field would be significant, thus making the relay less desirable for use in space, portable electronics, and other applications that demand low power consumption. The basic elements of a latching micro-magnetic switch include a permanent magnet, a substrate, a coil, and a cantilever at least partially made of soft magnetic materials. In its optimal configuration, the permanent magnet produces a static magnetic field that is relatively perpendicular to the horizontal plane of the cantilever. However, the magnetic field lines produced by a permanent magnet with a typical regular shape (disk, square, etc.) are not necessarily perpendicular to a plane, especially at the edge of the magnet. Then, any horizontal component of the magnetic field due to the permanent magnet can either eliminate one of the bistable states, or greatly increase the current that is needed to switch the cantilever from one state to the other. Careful alignment of the permanent magnet relative to the cantilever so as to locate the cantilever in the right spot of the permanent magnet field (usually near the center) will permit bi-stability and minimize switching current. Nevertheless, high-volume production of the switch can become difficult and costly if the alignment error tolerance is small. What is desired are bi-stable, latching relays or switches that do not require power to hold their states. Such a switch should be reliable, simple in design, low-cost and easy to manufacture, and should be useful in optical and/or electrical environments. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A method and apparatus for controlling the coupling of a first circuit into another circuit or signal path is described. A micro-machined latching switch (i.e., relay) of the present invention can be switched between two states. In a first state, the switch couples the first circuit into a signal path. In a second state, the switch provides a conductive path that bypasses the first circuit. In an aspect of the present invention, a moveable element is supported by a substrate and has a magnetic material and a long axis. At least one magnet produces a first magnetic field. The first magnetic field induces a magnetization in the magnetic material. The magnetization is characterized by a magnetization vector pointing in a direction along the long axis of the moveable element. The first magnetic field is approximately perpendicular to a major central portion of the long axis. A coil produces a second magnetic field to switch the moveable element between first and second stable states. Temporary application of the second magnetic field is required to change direction of the magnetization vector, which causes the moveable element to switch between the first and second stable states. In the first stable state, the moveable element does not couple the first circuit in series with a signal. In the second stable state, the moveable element couples the first circuit in series with the signal. The first circuit can include any number of components and component configurations. In an aspect, the first circuit is an attenuator circuit, such as a resistive attenuator circuit. In another aspect, the first circuit is a capacitive circuit. In another aspect, the first circuit is a filter circuit. In further aspects, the first circuit can be other circuit types. In aspects of the present invention, the moveable element can include one, two, three, or more electrically conductive portions. In one aspect, the moveable element includes first and second electrically conductive portions. In a first stable state, the first electrically conductive portion forms an electrically conductive path (e.g., a short circuit) in series with the signal. In the second stable state, the second electrically conductive portion couples a first signal line of the signal to the circuit. In another aspect, the moveable element comprises first, second, and third electrically conductive portions. In the first stable state, the first electrically conductive portion forms an electrically conductive path in series with the signal. In the second stable state, the second electrically conductive portion couples a first signal line of the signal to an input to the circuit, and the third electrically conductive portion couples a second signal line of the signal to an output of the circuit. In another aspect, a pair of moveable elements are used to couple the circuit into the signal path. A first signal line of the signal path is coupled to the first moveable element, and a second signal line of the signal path is coupled to the second moveable element. In the first stable state, the pair of moveable elements are electrically coupled together. Thus, in the first stable state, the circuit is not coupled into the signal path. In the second stable state, the circuit is coupled into the signal path between the moveable elements. The latching micro-magnetic switch of the present invention can be used in a plethora of products including household and industrial appliances, consumer electronics, military hardware, medical devices and vehicles of all types, just to name a few broad categories of goods.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Introduction It should be appreciated that the particular implementations shown and described herein are examples of the invention and are not intended to otherwise limit the scope of the present invention in any way. Indeed, for the sake of brevity, conventional electronics, manufacturing, MEMS technologies and other functional aspects of the systems (and components of the individual operating components of the systems) may not be described in detail herein. Furthermore, for purposes of brevity, the invention is frequently described herein as pertaining to a micro-electronically-machined relay for use in electrical or electronic systems. It should be appreciated that many other manufacturing techniques could be used to create the relays described herein, and that the techniques described herein could be used in mechanical relays, optical relays or any other switching device. Further, the techniques would be suitable for application in electrical systems, optical systems, consumer electronics, industrial electronics, wireless systems, space applications, or any other application. The terms, chip, integrated circuit, monolithic device, semiconductor device, and microelectronic device, are often used interchangeably in this field. The present invention is applicable to all the above as they are generally understood in the field. The terms metal line, transmission line, interconnect line, trace, wire, conductor, signal path and signaling medium are all related. The related terms listed above, are generally interchangeable, and appear in order from specific to general. In this field, metal lines are sometimes referred to as traces, wires, lines, interconnect or simply metal. Metal lines, generally aluminum (Al), copper (Cu) or an alloy of Al and Cu, are conductors that provide signal paths for coupling or interconnecting, electrical circuitry. Conductors other than metal are available in microelectronic devices. Materials such as doped polysilicon, doped single-crystal silicon (often referred to simply as diffusion, regardless of whether such doping is achieved by thermal diffusion or ion implantation), titanium (Ti), molybdenum (Mo), and refractory metal silicides are examples of other conductors. The terms contact and via, both refer to structures for electrical connection of conductors from different interconnect levels. These terms are sometimes used in the art to describe both an opening in an insulator in which the structure will be completed, and the completed structure itself. For purposes of this disclosure, contact and via refer to the completed structure. The term vertical, as used herein, means substantially orthogonal to the surface of a substrate. Moreover, it should be understood that the spatial descriptions (e.g., above, below, up, down, top, bottom, etc.) made herein are for purposes of illustration only, and that practical latching relays can be spatially arranged in any orientation or manner. The above-described micro-magnetic latching switch is further described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,469,602 (titled Electronically Switching Latching Micro-magnetic Relay And Method of Operating Same). This patent provides a thorough background on micro-magnetic latching switches and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Overview of a Latching Switch FIGS. 1A and 1B show side and top views, respectively, of a latching switch. The terms switch and device are used herein interchangeably to described the structure of the present invention. With reference to FIGS. 1A and 1B, an exemplary latching relay 100 suitably includes a magnet 102, a substrate 104, an insulating layer 106 housing a conductor 114, a contact 108 and a cantilever (moveable element) 112 positioned or supported above substrate by a staging layer 110. Magnet 102 is any type of magnet such as a permanent magnet, an electromagnet, or any other type of magnet capable of generating a magnetic field H0 134, as described more fully below. By way of example and not limitation, the magnet 102 can be a model 59-P09213T001 magnet available from the Dexter Magnetic Technologies corporation of Fremont, Calif., although of course other types of magnets could be used. Magnetic field 134 can be generated in any manner and with any magnitude, such as from about 1 Oersted to 104 Oersted or more. The strength of the field depends on the force required to hold the cantilever in a given state, and thus is implementation dependent. In the exemplary embodiment shown in FIG. 1A, magnetic field H0 134 can be generated approximately parallel to the Z axis and with a magnitude on the order of about 370 Oersted, although other embodiments will use varying orientations and magnitudes for magnetic field 134. In various embodiments, a single magnet 102 can be used in conjunction with a number of relays 100 sharing a common substrate 104. Substrate 104 is formed of any type of substrate material such as silicon, gallium arsenide, glass, plastic, metal or any other substrate material. In various embodiments, substrate 104 can be coated with an insulating material (such as an oxide) and planarized or otherwise made flat. In various embodiments, a number of latching relays 100 can share a single substrate 104. Alternatively, other devices (such as transistors, diodes, or other electronic devices) could be formed upon substrate 104 along with one or more relays 100 using, for example, conventional integrated circuit manufacturing techniques. Alternatively, magnet 102 could be used as a substrate and the additional components discussed below could be formed directly on magnet 102. In such embodiments, a separate substrate 104 may not be required. Insulating layer 106 is formed of any material such as oxide or another insulator such as a thin-film insulator. In an exemplary embodiment, insulating layer is formed of Probimide 7510 material. Insulating layer 106 suitably houses conductor 114. Conductor 114 is shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B to be a single conductor having two ends 126 and 128 arranged in a coil pattern. Alternate embodiments of conductor 114 use single or multiple conducting segments arranged in any suitable pattern such as a meander pattern, a serpentine pattern, a random pattern, or any other pattern. Conductor 114 is formed of any material capable of conducting electricity such as gold, silver, copper, aluminum, metal or the like. As conductor 114 conducts electricity, a magnetic field is generated around conductor 114 as discussed more fully below. Cantilever (moveable element) 112 is any armature, extension, outcropping or member that is capable of being affected by magnetic force. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1A, cantilever 112 suitably includes a magnetic layer 118 and a conducting layer 120. Magnetic layer 118 can be formulated of permalloy (such as NiFe alloy) or any other magnetically sensitive material. Conducting layer 120 can be formulated of gold, silver, copper, aluminum, metal or any other conducting material. In various embodiments, cantilever 112 exhibits two states corresponding to whether relay 100 is open or closed, as described more fully below. In many embodiments, relay 100 is said to be closed when a conducting layer 120, connects staging layer 110 to contact 108. Conversely, the relay may be said to be open when cantilever 112 is not in electrical contact with contact 108. Because cantilever 112 can physically move in and out of contact with contact 108, various embodiments of cantilever 112 will be made flexible so that cantilever 112 can bend as appropriate. Flexibility can be created by varying the thickness of the cantilever (or its various component layers), by patterning or otherwise making holes or cuts in the cantilever, or by using increasingly flexible materials. Although the dimensions of cantilever 112 can vary dramatically from implementation to implementation, an exemplary cantilever 112 suitable for use in a micro-magnetic relay 100 can be on the order of 10-1000 microns in length, 1-40 microns in thickness, and 2-600 microns in width. For example, an exemplary cantilever in accordance with the embodiment shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B can have dimensions of about 600 microns10 microns50 microns, or 1000 microns600 microns25 microns, or any other suitable dimensions. Contact 108 and staging layer 110 are placed on insulating layer 106, as appropriate. In various embodiments, staging layer 110 supports cantilever 112 above insulating layer 106, creating a gap 116 that can be vacuum or can become filled with air or another gas or liquid such as oil. Although the size of gap 116 varies widely with different implementations, an exemplary gap 116 can be on the order of 1-100 microns, such as about 20 microns, Contact 108 can receive cantilever 112 when relay 100 is in a closed state, as described below. Contact 108 and staging layer 110 can be formed of any conducting material such as gold, gold alloy, silver, copper, aluminum, metal or the like. In various embodiments, contact 108 and staging layer 110 are formed of similar conducting materials, and the relay is considered to be closed when cantilever 112 completes a circuit between staging layer 110 and contact 108. In certain embodiments wherein cantilever 112 does not conduct electricity, staging layer 110 can be formulated of non-conducting material such as Probimide material, oxide, or any other material. Additionally, alternate embodiments may not require staging layer 110 if cantilever 112 is otherwise supported above insulating layer 106. Alternatively, cantilever 112 can be made into a hinged arrangement. For example, FIGS. 1C and 1D show side and top views, respectively, of a latching relay 100 incorporating a hinge 160, according to an embodiment of the present invention. Hinge 160 centrally attaches cantilever 112, in contrast to staging layer 110, which attaches an end of cantilever 112. Hinge 160 is supported on first and second hinge supports 140a and 140b. Latching relay 100 shown in FIGS. 1C and 1D operates substantially similarly to the switch embodiment shown in FIGS. 1A and 1D, except that cantilever 112 flexes or rotates around hinge 160 when changing states. Indicator line 150 shown in FIG. 1C indicates a central axis of cantilever 112 around which cantilever 112 rotates. Hinge 160 and hinge supports 140a and 140b can be made from electrically or non-electrically conductive materials, similarly to staging layer 110. Relay 100 is considered to be closed when cantilever 112 completes a circuit between one or both of first and second hinge supports 140a and 104b, and contact 108. Relay 100 can be formed in any number of sizes, proportions, and configurations. FIGS. 1E and 1F show examples of relay 100, according to embodiments of the present invention. Note that the examples of relay 100 shown in FIGS. 1E and 1F are provided for purposes of illustration, and are not intended to limit the invention. FIG. 1E shows an example relay 100 having a fixed end configuration, similar to the embodiment shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B. In the example of FIG. 1E, cantilever 112 has the dimensions of 700 &mgr;m300 &mgr;m30 &mgr;m. A thickness of cantilever 112 is 5 &mgr;m. Air gap 116 (not shown in FIG. 1E) has a spacing of 12 &mgr;m under cantilever 112. An associated coil 114 (not shown in FIG. 1E) has 20 turns. FIG. 1F shows an example relay 100 having a hinge structure, similarly to the embodiment shown in FIGS. 1C and 1D. In the example of FIG. 1F, cantilever 112 has the dimensions of 800 &mgr;m200 &mgr;m25 &mgr;m. A pair of torsion flexures (not shown in FIG. 1F) are located in the center of cantilever 112 to provide the hinge function. Each flexure has dimensions of 280 &mgr;m20 &mgr;m3 &mgr;m. Air gap 116 (not shown in FIG. 1F) has a spacing of 12 &mgr;m under cantilever 112. An associated coil 114 (not shown in FIG. 1F) has 20 turns. Principle of Operation of a Micro-Magnetic Latching Switch When it is in the down position, the cantilever makes electrical contact with the bottom conductor, and the switch is ON (also called the closed state). When the contact end is up, the switch is OFF (also called the open state). These two stable states produce the switching function by the moveable cantilever element. The permanent magnet holds the cantilever in either the up or the down position after switching, making the device a latching relay. A current is passed through the coil (e.g., the coil is energized) only during a brief (temporary) period of time to transition between the two states. (i) Method to Produce Bi-Stability The principle by which bi-stability is produced is illustrated with reference to FIG. 2. When the length L of a permalloy cantilever 112 is much larger than its thickness t and width (w, not shown), the direction along its long axis L becomes the preferred direction for magnetization (also called the easy axis). When a major central portion of the cantilever is placed in a uniform permanent magnetic field, a torque is exerted on the cantilever. The torque can be either clockwise or counterclockwise, depending on the initial orientation of the cantilever with respect to the magnetic field. When the angle (&agr;) between the cantilever axis (&xgr;) and the external field (H0) is smaller than 90, the torque is counterclockwise; and when &agr; is larger than 90, the torque is clockwise. The bi-directional torque arises because of the bi-directional magnetization (i.e., a magnetization vector m points one direction or the other direction, as shown in FIG. 2) of the cantilever (m points from left to right when &agr;<90, and from right to left when &agr;>90). Due to the torque, the cantilever tends to align with the external magnetic field (H0). However, when a mechanical force (such as the elastic torque of the cantilever, a physical stopper, etc.) preempts to the total realignment with H0, two stable positions (up and down) are available, which forms the basis of latching in the switch. (ii) Electrical Switching If the bi-directional magnetization along the easy axis of the cantilever arising from H0 can be momentarily reversed by applying a second magnetic field to overcome the influence of (H0), then it is possible to achieve a switchable latching relay. This scenario is realized by situating a planar coil under or over the cantilever to produce the required temporary switching field. The planar coil geometry was chosen because it is relatively simple to fabricate, though other structures (such as a wrap-around, three dimensional type) are also possible. The magnetic field (Hcoil) lines generated by a short current pulse loop around the coil. It is mainly the &xgr;-component (along the cantilever, see FIG. 2) of this field that is used to reorient the magnetization (magnetization vector m) in the cantilever. The direction of the coil current determines whether a positive or a negative &xgr;-field component is generated. Plural coils can be used. After switching, the permanent magnetic field holds the cantilever in this state until the next switching event is encountered. Since the &xgr;-component of the coil-generated field (Hcoil-&xgr;) only needs to be momentarily larger than the &xgr;-component &lsqb;H0&xgr;H0 cos(&agr;)&equals;H0 sin(&phgr;), &agr;&equals;90&phgr;&rsqb; of the permanent magnetic field and &phgr; is typically very small (e.g., &phgr;&lE;5), switching current and power can be very low, which is an important consideration in micro relay design. The operation principle can be summarized as follows: A permalloy cantilever in a uniform (in practice, the field can be just approximately uniform) magnetic field can have a clockwise or a counterclockwise torque depending on the angle between its long axis (easy axis, L) and the field. Two bi-stable states are possible when other forces can balance die torque. A coil can generate a momentary magnetic field to switch the orientation of magnetization (vector m) along the cantilever and thus switch the cantilever between the two states. Relaxed Alignment of Magnets The second magnetic field may be generated through, for example, a magnet such as an electronically-controlled electromagnet. Alternatively, the second magnetic field may be generated by passing a current through conductor 114. As current passes through conductor 114, a magnetic field is produced in accordance with a right-hand rule. For example, a current flowing from point 126 to point 128 on conductor 114 (FIG. 1B) typically generates a magnetic field into the center of the coil shown, corresponding to field arrows 122 in FIG. 1A. Conversely, a current flowing from point 128 to point 126 in FIG. 1 generates a magnetic field flowing out of the center o the coil shown, corresponding to dashed field arrows 124 in FIG. 1A. The magnetic field may loop around the conductor 114 in a maimer shown also in FIG. 1A, imposing a horizontal (X) component of the magnetic field on the cantilever 112. By varying the direction of the current or current pulse flowing in conductor 114. then, the direction of the second magnetic field can be altered as desire . By altering the direction of the second magnetic field, the magnetization of cantilever 112 may be affected and relay 100 may be suitably switched open or closed. When the second magnetic field is in the direction of field arrows 122, for example, the magnetization of cantilever 112 will point toward end 130. This magnetization creates a clockwise torque about end 130 that places cantilever 112 in a down state that suitably closes relay 100. Conversely, when the second magnetic field is in the direction of dashed field arrows 124, the magnetization of cantilever 112 points toward end 132, and a counter-clockwise torque is produced that places cantilever 112 in an up state that suitably opens relay 100. Hence, the up or down state of cantilever 112 (and hence the open or closed state of relay 100) may be adjusted by controlling the current flowing through conductor 114. Further, since the magnetization of cantilever 112 remains constant without external perturbation, the second magnetic field may be applied in pulse or otherwise intermittently as required to switch the relay. When the relay does not require a change of state, power to conductor 114 may be eliminated, thus creating a bi-stable latching relay 100 without power consumption in quiescent states. Such a relay is well suited for applications in space, aeronautics, portable electronics, and the like. To address the issue of relaxing the magnet alignment requirement, the inventors have developed a technique to create perpendicular magnetic fields in a relatively large region around the cantilever. The invention is based on the fact that the magnetic field lines in a low permeability media (e.g., air) are basically perpendicular to the surface of a very high permeability material (e.g., materials that are easily magnetized, such as permalloy). When the cantilever is placed in proximity to such a surface and the cantilever&apos;s horizontal plane is parallel to the surface of the high permeability material, the above stated objectives can be at least partially achieved. The generic scheme is described below, followed by illustrative embodiments of the invention. The boundary conditions for the magnetic flux density (B) and magnetic field (H) follow the following relationships:                or B2  n &equals; B1  n, B2  n &equals; (&mgr;2/&mgr;1) B1  n    H2  n &equals; (&mgr;2/&mgr;1) H1  n, H2  n &equals; H1  n           If &mgr;1>>&mgr;2, the normal component of H2 is much larger than the normal component of H1, as shown in FIG. 3. In the limit (&mgr;1/&mgr;2)&square;&square;, the magnetic field H2 is normal to the boundary surface, independent of the direction of H1 (barring the exceptional case of H1 exactly parallel to the interface). If the second media is air (&mgr;2&equals;1), then B2&equals;&mgr;0 H2, so that the flux lines B2 will also be perpendicular to the surface. This property is used to produce magnetic fields that are perpendicular to the horizontal plane of the cantilever in a micro-magnetic latching switch and to relax the permanent magnet alignment requirements. This property, where the magnetic field is normal to the boundary surface of a high-permeability material, and the placement of the cantilever (i.e., soft magnetic) with its horizontal plane parallel to the surface of the high-permeability material, can be used in many different configurations to relax the permanent magnet alignment requirement. Connecting Circuits Using Micro-Magnetic Latching Switches of the Present Invention Operation of the micro-magnetic latching switches of the present invention, described above, can be used to implement various electrical and optical components. For example, components can be formed by using the latching switches of the present invention to couple circuits into and out of signal paths and/or other circuits as needed. Any type of circuit may be coupled into a signal path/other circuit, including discrete components, such as resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, transistors, and other discrete components, active components, such as amplifiers, any combination of components, such as attenuator and filter circuits, and any other circuit type. Example embodiments are provided below that use latching switches to couple circuits into signal paths, as are example circuits that can be coupled into the signal paths. These embodiments are provided for illustrative purposes only, and are not limiting. Alternative embodiments will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art(s) based on the discussion contained herein. As will be appreciated by persons skilled in the relevant art(s), other circuits and latching switch configurations are within the scope and spirit of the present invention. The micro-magnetic latching switches of the present invention are particularly useful for these applications. They have advantages of being small, having very low insertion loss, and having very good linearity. Available conventional switch technology that would be used for such an application has limitations. For example, PIN diodes have high insertion loss and consume considerable power. GaAs FETs have mediocre RF performance, and conventional relays are large, expensive, and have limited contact life. FIGS. 4A-4E illustrate block diagrams showing various example circuit-coupling blocks that use latching switches of the present invention to couple a circuit into a signal path. FIGS. 4A-4E focus on showing different types of cantilever 112, and do not show all elements of relay 100, which are described in further detail elsewhere herein. In each of FIGS. 4A-4E, one or more latching relays 100 couple a circuit 410 in and out of a signal path between a first signal line 402 and a second signal line 404. First and second signal lines 402 and 404 may also be considered to be signal lines that interface with another circuit. By switching a latching micro-magnetic switch between first and second states, circuit 410is either bypassed, or is coupled between first signal line 402 and second signal line 404. FIG. 4A shows a circuit-coupling block 450 that includes a fixed-end relay 100. Circuit-coupling block 450 is suitable for DC and low-frequency signal applications, although may be appropriate in some RF applications. In a first state for relay 100, cantilever 112 is in a first position 422, and the moveable end of cantilever 112 is in contact with a first contact 108a. In first position 422, first signal line 402 is coupled directly to second signal line 404 by a conductive path that includes staging layer 110 and cantilever 112. Thus, in the first state, circuit 410 has no effect on a signal transmitting between first signal line 402 and second signal line 404. In a second state for relay 100 of block 450, cantilever 112 is in a second position 424, and the moveable end of cantilever 112 is in contact with a second contact 108b. In second position 424, circuit 410 is coupled into the signal path between first signal line 402 and second signal line 404, and thus can have an effect on a signal transmitting between first signal line 402 and second signal line 404. Note that the configuration shown in FIG. 4A can be modified to use a hinged cantilever 112. Furthermore, note that in an alternative embodiment, contacts 108a and 108b can be reversed, so that circuit 410 is coupled between first signal line 402 and second signal line 404 when cantilever 112 is in first position 422. It will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art(s) that such alternative configurations are applicable to all of the embodiments described herein. FIG. 4B shows a circuit-coupling block 460 having a relay 100 with hinged cantilever 112. Circuit-coupling block 460 is suitable for DC and low-frequency signal applications, although may be appropriate in some RF applications. In block 460, cantilever 112 can conduct an electrical signal along its length. In a first state for relay 100, cantilever 112 is in a first position 422, and cantilever 112 couples first contact 108a to a fourth contact 108d. Thus, in first position 422, first signal line 402 is coupled by a conductive path through cantilever 112 directly to second signal line 404. Hence, in the first state, circuit 410 has no effect on a signal transmitting between first signal line 402 and second signal line 404. In a second state for relay 100 of block 460, cantilever 112 is in a second position 424, coupling second contact 108b to a third contact 108c. Thus, in second position 424, circuit 410 is coupled into the signal path between first signal line 402 and second signal line 404, and therefore can have an effect on a signal transmitting between first signal line 402 and second signal line 404. FIG. 4C shows a circuit-coupling block 470 having a relay 100 with hinged cantilever 112. Circuit-coupling block 470 is suitable for DC and low-frequency signal applications, although may be appropriate in some RF applications. Cantilever 112 has two electrically conductive portions: first electrically conductive portion 434 and second electrically conductive portion 436. An body 432 of cantilever 112 electrically separates first and second electrically conductive portions 434 and 436. Cantilever 112 hinges around indicator line 150, such that as first electrically conductive portion 434 moves upward (i.e., out of the page), second electrically conductive portion 436 moves downward (i.e., into the page), and vice versa. In a first state for relay 100, cantilever 112 couples first contact 108a to third contact 108c with first electrically conductive portion 434. Thus, in this first state, first signal line 402 is coupled through a conductive path of first electrically conductive portion 434 directly to second signal line 404. Hence, in the first state, circuit 410 has no effect on a signal transmitting between first signal line 402 and second signal line 404. In a second state for relay 100 of block 470, cantilever 112 couples second contact 108b to a fourth contact 108d with second electrically conductive portion 436. Thus, in this second state, circuit 410 is coupled into the signal path between first signal line 402 and second signal line 404. Therefore, circuit 410 can have an effect on a signal transmitting between first signal line 402 and second signal line 404. FIG. 4D shows a circuit-coupling block 480 having a relay 100 with hinged cantilever 112. Circuit-coupling block 480 is suitable for DC, low-frequency, and high frequency signal applications, including RF applications. Cantilever 112 has three electrically conductive portions: first electrically conductive portion 444, second electrically conductive portion 446, and third electrically conductive portion 448. Body 432 of cantilever 112 electrically separates first, second, and third electrically conductive portions 444, 446, and 448. Cantilever 112 hinges around indicator line 150, such that as first electrically conductive portion 444 moves upward (i.e., out of the page), second and third electrically conductive portions 446 and 448 move downward (i.e., into the page), and vice versa. In block 480, circuit 410 is coupled between fifth and sixth contacts 108e and 108f. In a first state for relay 100, cantilever 112 couples first contact 108a to third contact 108c with a conductive path of first electrically conductive portion 444. Thus, in this first state, first signal line 402 is coupled through first electrically conductive portion 444 directly to second signal line 404. Therefore, in the first state, circuit 410 has no effect on a signal transmitting between first signal line 402 and second signal line 404. In a second state for relay 100 of block 480, cantilever 112 couples fourth contact 108d to fifth contact 108e through second electrically conductive portion 446, and couples second contact 108b to sixth contact 108e through third electrically conductive portion 448. Thus, in this second state, circuit 410 is coupled into the signal path between first signal line 402 and second signal line 404 by a conductive path that includes second and third electrically conductive portions 446 and 448. Therefore, in the second state, circuit 410can have an effect on a signal transmitting between first signal line 402 and second signal line 404. FIG. 4E shows a circuit-coupling block 490 having first and second relays 100a and 100b, each with a corresponding cantilever 112a and 112b, respectively. Cantilevers 112a and 112b can be either fixed-end or hinged types. Circuit-coupling block 490 is suitable for DC, low-frequency, and high frequency signal applications, and is particularly suitable for RF applications. In block 490, circuit 410 is coupled between second and fourth contacts 108b and 108d. In a first state for relays 100a and 100b, cantilever 112a couples first signal line 402 to third contact 108c, and cantilever 112b couples first contact 108a to second signal line 404. A third signal line 462 forms a conductive path between third contact 108c and first contact 108a. Third signal line 462 is a wire, cable, trace, transmission line, or any other electrically conductive signal path. Thus, in this first state, first signal line 402 is coupled through third signal line 462 directly to second signal line 404. Therefore, in the first state, circuit 410 has no effect on a signal transmitting between first signal line 402 and second signal line 404. In a second state for relays 100a and 100b of block 490, cantilevers 112a couples first signal line 402 to fourth contact 108d, and cantilever 112b couples second contact 108b to second signal line 404. Thus, in this second state, circuit 410 is coupled into the signal path between first signal line 402 and second signal line 404. Therefore, in the second state, circuit 410 can have an effect on a signal transmitting between first signal line 402 and second signal line 404. Note that in either state for block 490, there are no signal line stubs hanging from a conducting portion of the signal path between first and second signal lines 402 and 404 that can adversely affect RF performance.

A detailed circuit-coupling block 600 is shown in FIGS. 6A and 6B, according to an example embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 6A illustrates a detailed top view, and FIG. 6B illustrates a perspective view, of a relay 100 that couples circuit 410into a signal path. For illustrative purposes, circuit 410 is shown in FIG. 6A as resistor-based attenuator configuration 502. As shown in FIG. 6A, a first signal line 402 is electrically coupled to a second signal line 404 by cantilever 112 of relay 100. Relay 100 is of the hinged-type, and includes hinges 160a and 160b that are attached to cantilever 112, and about which cantilever 112 rotates. Cantilever 112 comprises three electrical contact regions: first, second, and third electrically conductive portions 444, 446, and 448. In a first state, first electrically conductive portion 444 of cantilever 112 electrically connects portions 430 and 432 of signal lines 402 and 404, respectively. In a second state, second and third electrically conductive portions 446 and 448 electrically connect signal lines 402 and 404 through circuit 410.

Embodiments of the present invention for coupling a circuit to a signal path can be used individually, or may be cascaded together in series, in combinations of any number of two or more. For example, cascaded embodiments of the present invention may be used to create devices, such as a phased array antenna device or other device type. Such a device includes a plurality of circuit-coupling blocks that each control the coupling of a circuit into a signal path. Example programmable attenuator devices are described below to illustrate an how embodiments of the present invention may be coupled in series. The present invention is not limited to these example embodiments. It would understood to persons skilled in the relevant art(s) how to implement alternative series-coupled devices, according to the present invention, from the teachings herein. FIGS. 7A and 7B illustrate example series-coupled, programmable devices, according to embodiments of the present invention. FIG. 7A illustrates a block diagram of a 4-bit programmable attenuator 700 using four series-coupled circuit-coupling blocks 490a-d, as shown in FIG. 4E. FIG. 7B shows a detailed example schematic diagram of an alternative attenuator 700 using four series-coupled circuit-coupling blocks 600a-d, as shown in FIG. 6A. Each of blocks 490a-d and blocks 600a-d are paired with a corresponding circuit 410a-d.  As shown in FIGS. 7A and 7B, an RF input signal 702 is applied to an input of programmable attenuator 700, and an RF output signal 704 is produced at an output of attenuator 700. Each of circuit-coupling blocks 490a-d and 600a-d are used as attenuator blocks to switch in or out of the signal path a corresponding amount of attenuation. Switching of associated coils is described in further detail above. Circuits 410a-d provide 1, 2, 4, and 8 decibels (dBs) of attenuation, respectively. In this manner, up to 15 dBs of attenuation can be added in increments of one dB. Other configurations and weightings of attenuator blocks can be implemented without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Furthermore, alternatively, capacitive blocks can be used in a similar arrangement, rather that attenuator blocks, to form a programmable capacitive network device. Furthermore, filter blocks can be instead used, to create a programmable filter device. Still further, delay blocks can be used to create a programmable delay device. For example, circuits 410a-n can each include a delay element, such as a delay circuit or length of transmission line. The length of transmission line can be of a different length than the short circuit signal path, to create a variation in delay. Moreover, other circuit-coupling blocks or elements, such as phase array antenna elements, can be substituted in place of attenuator blocks 710a-d, to create a programmable antenna device, without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Thus, the present invention can be used to create variable attenuators, steerable antennas (phased array antennas), automotive collision avoidance systems, variable phase delay circuits, variable inductors, variable capacitors, variable filters, and the like. The use of the latching micro-magnetic switches of the present invention for switching in and out various phase array antenna elements, and/or other circuits, will be apparent to a person skilled in the relevant art based on the description herein. In an embodiment, a circuit-coupling block of the present invention, such as those shown in FIGS. 4A-4E, could be manufactured as a single integrated circuit chip, with all components on-chip except for circuit 410. Such a chip has user-available I/O pins for coupling circuit 410 to the chip, to make a complete system. Thus, general purpose circuit-coupling blocks could be placed in chips for use or sale, where a user could determine which type of circuit to couple to the chip, depending on the particular application. Furthermore, in embodiments, a chip could have a plurality of series-coupled blocks, with multiple user-available I/O pins for coupling multiple circuits 410 into a signal path. Example Embodiments for Performing the Present Invention FIG. 8 shows a flowchart 800 providing steps for controlling the coupling of a circuit into a signal path, according to an example embodiment of the present invention. The steps of FIG. 8 do not necessarily have to occur in the order shown, as will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art(s) based on the teachings herein. Other structural and operational embodiments will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art(s) based on the following discussion. These steps are described in detail below. Flowchart 800 begins with step 802. In step 802, a first magnetic field is produced which induces a magnetization in a magnetic material of a moveable element, the magnetization characterized by a magnetization vector pointing in a direction along a longitudinal axis of the moveable element, the first magnetic field being approximately perpendicular to the longitudinal axis. For example, the first magnetic field is HO 134, as shown in FIGS. 1A and 1C. The magnetic field can be produced by magnet 102, which can be a permanent magnet. In an alternative embodiment, the magnetic field is produced by more than one permanent magnet, such as a first permanent magnet above and a second permanent magnet below cantilever 112. A magnetization induced in the magnetic material can be characterized as a magnetization vector, such as magnetization vector m as shown in FIG. 2. As shown in FIGS. 1A and 1C, first magnetic field HO 134 is approximately perpendicular to a long axis L for cantilever 112 (e.g., as shown in FIG. 2). In step 804, a second magnetic field is produced to switch the moveable element between a first stable state and a second stable state, wherein only temporary application of the second magnetic field is required to change direction of the magnetization vector thereby causing the moveable element to switch between the first stable state and the second stable state. For example, the second magnetic field is produced by coil 114 shown in FIGS. 1A-1D. The second magnetic field switches cantilever 112 between two stable states, such as the first and second stable states described above. As described above, only a temporary application of the second magnetic field produced by coil 114 is required to change direction of magnetization vector m shown in FIG. 2. Changing the direction of magnetization vector m causes cantilever 112 to switch between the first stable state and the second stable state. In step 806, the moveable element is allowed to couple a electrically conductive path in series with a signal when in the first stable state. For example, FIGS. 4A-4C illustrate how short circuits/conductive paths are coupled between first signal line 402 and second signal line 404 by cantilever 112 when in a first stable state. In step 808, the moveable element is allowed to couple a circuit in series with the signal when in the second stable state. For example, FIGS. 4A-4C each illustrate how circuit 410can be coupled between first signal line 402 and second signal line 404 by cantilever 112 when in a second stable state.

', '   This application claims priority to prior application JP 2002-158526, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a noise filter that is mounted in an electronic device or electronic equipment for removing noise generated therein. Digital technologies are important technologies supporting IT (Information Technology) industries. Recently, digital circuit technologies such as LSI (Large Scale Integration) have been used in not only computers and communication-related devices, but also household electric appliances and vehicle equipment. High-frequency noise currents generated in LSI chips or the like do not stay in the neighborhood of the LSI chips but spread over wide ranges within mounting circuit boards such as printed circuit boards, and are subjected to inductive coupling in signal wiring or ground wiring, thereby leading from signal cables or the like as electromagnetic waves. In those circuits each including an analog circuit and a digital circuit, such as a circuit in which part of a conventional analog circuit is replaced with a digital circuit, or a digital circuit having analog input and output, electromagnetic interference from the digital circuit to the analog circuit has been becoming a serious problem. As a countermeasure therefor, a technique of power supply decoupling is effective wherein an LSI chip as a source of generation of high-frequency current is separated from a dc power supply system in terms of high frequencies. Noise filters such as bypass capacitors have been used hitherto as decoupling elements, and the operation principle of the power supply decoupling is simple and clear. The capacitors as noise filters used in conventional ac circuits form two-terminal lumped constant noise filters and solid electrolytic capacitors, electric double-layer capacitors, ceramic capacitors or the like are often used therefor. When carrying out removal of electrical noise in an ac circuit over a wide frequency band, inasmuch as a frequency band that can be dealt with by one capacitor is relatively narrow, different kinds of capacitors, for example, an aluminum electrolytic capacitor, a tantalum capacitor and a ceramic capacitor having different self-resonance frequencies, are provided in the ac circuit. Conventionally, however, it has been bothersome to select and design a plurality of noise filters that are used for removing electrical noise of a wide frequency band. In addition, there has been a problem that, because of using different kinds of the noise filters, the cost is high, the size is large, and the weight is heavy. Further, as described above, for dealing with higher-speed and higher-frequency digital circuits, there have been demanded those noise filters that can ensure decoupling over a high frequency band and exhibit low impedances even in the high frequency band. However, the two-terminal lumped constant noise filters have difficulty in maintaining low impedances up to the high frequency band due to self-resonance phenomena of capacitors, and thus are inferior in performance of removing high-frequency band noise. Further, the electronic equipment or devices with the LSI chips or the like mounted therein have been required to be further reduced in size, weight and cost. Therefore, the noise filters that are used in those electronic equipment or devices have also been required to be further reduced in size, to be structured more simply, and to be manufactured more easily. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a transmission line type noise filter that is excellent in noise removing characteristic over a wide band including a high frequency band and that has a small size and a simple structure. A transmission line type-noise filter according to the present invention has a central conductor, an external conductor, and a dielectric formed between the central conductor and the external conductor, and is characterized by comprising a metal fine wire made of valve-operational metal and serving as the central conductor; a capacitance forming portion formed over a predetermined length on the periphery of the metal fine wire; and a conductor layer formed on a surface of the capacitance forming portion and serving as the external conductor, wherein the capacitance forming portion comprises a sintered body formed on the metal fine wire and made of the foregoing valve-operational metal; a dielectric film formed on a surface of the sintered body and serving as the dielectric; and a solid electrolyte layer formed on a surface of the dielectric film. The sintered body may be formed by press-molding powder of the valve-operational metal, then sintering it at a predetermined temperature, or may be formed by winding a green sheet formed from slurry including powder of the valve-operational metal, around the metal fine wire as a core, then sintering it at a predetermined temperature. The dielectric film may be an oxidized film of the valve-operational metal. The valve-operational metal may be tantalum or niobium. The solid electrolyte layer may be formed by a single conductive high molecular compound layer or a plurality of conductive high molecular compound layers. The transmission line type noise filter may further comprise a first and a second anode terminal connected to both ends of the metal fine wire, respectively; a cathode terminal connected to the conductor layer; and a resin package covering the metal fine wire, the capacitance forming portion and the conductor layer, excluding at least portions of the first and second anode terminals and the cathode terminal, respectively, thereby to be formed as an electronic element.

The noise filter 10 comprises a tantalum fine wire 1 being a metal fine wire that has a predetermined length L and provides a valve operation, a conductor layer 2 having a length h and formed so as to cover the periphery of a central portion of the tantalum fine wire 1, a first anode terminal 4a and a second anode terminal 4b connected to both ends of the tantalum fine wire 1, respectively, a cathode terminal 5 connected to the conductor layer 2 using a conductive adhesive 6 such as silver paste, and a capacitance forming portion 3 provided between the tantalum fine wire 1 and the conductor layer 2. In the present invention, valve-operational metal represents such metal in which, when oxidized, an oxidized film thereof performs a valve operation. As shown in FIG. 2, the capacitance forming portion 3 comprises a tantalum sintered body 11 formed around the central portion of the tantalum fine wire 1 so as to be integral with the tantalum fine wire 1, an oxidized tantalum film 31 that is a dielectric film formed by oxidizing the surface of the tantalum sintered body 11, and a solid electrolyte layer 23 formed on the oxidized tantalum film 31. The capacitance forming portion 3 forms a solid electrolytic capacitance with the tantalum sintered body 11 and the solid electrolyte layer 23 serving as an anode and a cathode, respectively. As shown In FIG. 2, the tantalum sintered body 11 is porous like a pumice and has a very rough surface, and thus the surface area thereof is large. Therefore, the area of the oxidized tantalum film 31 formed on the surface of the tantalum sintered body 11 is also very large For example, as compared with a capacitance forming portion having the same volume as the capacitance forming portion 3 and made of a different material according to a different manufacturing method, a very high capacitance can be achieved. The solid electrolyte layer 23 is composed of two layers, i.e. a first conductive high molecular compound layer 23a directly contacting the oxidized tantalum film 31, and a second conductive high molecular compound layer 23b formed on the first conductive high molecular compound layer 23a. The solid electrolyte layer 23, however, may be composed of a layer of a single kind. As shown in FIG. 2, the conductor layer 2 comprises a graphite layer 25 formed on the surface of the solid electrolyte layer 23, and a silver coating layer 26 formed on the surface of the graphite layer 25. The cathode terminal 5 is connected to the silver coating layer 26 using the conductive adhesive 6. The length h of the conductor layer 2 and the size of a section of the conductor layer 2 perpendicular to a longitudinal direction of the tantalum fine wire 1 may be suitably determined depending on desired characteristics of the noise filter. For the solid electrolyte layer 23, a conductive high molecular compound can be used that includes a monomer of a ring organic compound such as pyrrole, aniline, thiophene or furan, or a polymer of a derivative thereof. A layer of the conductive high molecular compound can be formed on the surface of the oxidized tantalum film 31 through chemical oxidative polymerization. When forming the solid electrolyte layer 23 by a plurality of layers, such as two layers, of conductive high molecular compounds, a two-layer structure can be achieved by selection from the foregoing conductive high molecular compounds (duplicate selection of the same material is also possible). In this event, at least the conductive high molecular compound layer that directly contacts the surface of the oxidized tantalum film 31 is formed through chemical oxidative polymerization. The noise filter 10 according to this embodiment has the tantalum fine wire 1 serving as a central conductor while constitutes a transmission line of a coaxial-line type having the conductor layer 2 serving as an external conductor. Therefore, as compared with the conventional two-terminal lumped constant noise filters, the noise filter 10 has a lower impedance in a high frequency band, and thus is excellent in noise removing performance in the high frequency band. Further, inasmuch as the extremely large capacitance excellent in frequency characteristic can be realized between the tantalum fine wire 1 and the conductor layer 2, the impedance is very low over the wide frequency range even with the single noise filter, i.e. without using a plurality of capacitors having different self-resonance frequencies as in the conventional technique. As a result, the noise filter 10 can exhibit the excellent noise removing performance over the wide frequency range although its size is small and its structure is simple. In addition, inasmuch as it is no longer necessary to select, design or use the plurality of capacitors as required in the conventional technique, the total manufacturing cost can be reduced. Now, a manufacturing method of the noise filter 10 in this embodiment will be described. First, a binder that volatilizes at a predetermined temperature is mixed into tantalum powder 30 being porous metal powder around the central portion, in a longitudinal direction (hereinafter referred to as first direction), of the rectilinear tantalum fine wire 1 having the predetermined length L, then the mixture is press-molded by a die 60 as shown in FIG. 3, for example, so as to have the length h in the first direction. Subsequently, this press-molded mixture is sintered in a vacuum, thereby to obtain a tantalum sintered body (not shown). The binder volatilizes during sintering, and the residual tantalum sintered body is porous. Subsequently, this tantalum sintered body is immersed into a phosphoric acid liquid and, while applying a positive voltage to the tantalum sintered body and a negative voltage to the phosphoric acid liquid to control a thickness thereof, the surface of the tantalum sintered body is oxidized, thereby forming the oxidized tantalum film (dielectric) 31 having a desired thickness. Subsequently, the solid electrolyte layer 23 is formed on the surface of the oxidized tantalum film 31. Specifically, first, a polypyrrole layer, for example, is formed on the surface of the oxidized tantalum film 31 as the first conductive high molecular compound layer 23a through chemical oxidative polymerization, then a polypyrrole layer including conductive powder, for example, is formed on the first conductive high molecular compound layer 23a as the second conductive high molecular compound layer 23b through chemical oxidative polymerization or electrolytic oxidative polymerization. Subsequently, the graphite layer 25 and the silver coating layer 26 are formed on the second conductive high molecular compound layer 23b in a stacked manner for drawing out a cathode-side electrode. Thereafter, the first anode terminal 4a is welded to one end of the exposed tantalum fine wire 1 and the second anode terminal 4b is welded to the other end thereof, and the cathode terminal 5 and the silver coating layer 26 are bonded together using the conductive adhesive 6, then the composite is packaged using, for example, epoxy resin (not shown), thereby completing the noise filter 10 as an electronic element. In the present invention, the valve-operational metal is not limited to tantalum, and niobium (Nb) may also be used. Second Embodiment In the present invention, a manufacturing method as shown in FIGS. 4A and 4B can also be used with respect to a sintered body, other than the manufacturing method as described above using FIG. 3. Specifically, a green sheet 36 having a predetermined width h and thickness is formed from slurry including tantalum powder being porous metal powder and a binder that volatilizes at a predetermined temperature. Then, using a tantalum fine wire 1 having a predetermined length L (L>h) as a core, the green sheet 36 is wound around a central portion thereof a predetermined number of times, exposing both end portions of the tantalum fine wire 1. Subsequently, It is sintered in a vacuum so as to obtain a sintered wound body 37. The binder volatilizes during sintering, and the residual sintered wound body 37 is porous. Subsequently, the sintered wound body 37 is immersed into a phosphoric acid liquid and, while applying a positive voltage to the sintered wound body 37 and a negative voltage to the phosphoric acid liquid to control a thickness thereof, the surface of the sintered wound body 37 is oxidized, thereby forming an oxidized tantalum film (dielectric) having a desired thickness. Thereafter, the same processes as those in the first embodiment will be carried out. Also in case of this configuration and manufacturing method, niobium powder may be used instead of tantalum powder. Third Embodiment In the present invention, the external shape of the conductor layer 2 is not limited to a prismatic shape, i.e. a section of the conductor layer 2 perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the tantalum fine wire 1 is not limited to a rectangular shape. Specifically, as shown in FIG. 5, the external shape may be cylindrical, i.e. a section of a conductor layer 2 and a capacitance forming portion 3 perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the tantalum fine wire 1 may have a circular shape. Incidentally, FIG. 5 is a diagram corresponding to FIG. 1D when the conductor layer 2 and the capacitance forming portion 3 are cylindrical in shape. While the present invention has thus far been described in conjunction with the embodiments thereof, it will readily be possible for those skilled in the art to put the present invention into practice in various other manners.

The surface acoustic wave apparatus includes at least one IDT primarily including Cu and arranged on a 23 to 46-rotated Y plate LiTaO3 substrate. The SiO2 film is arranged on the LiTaO3 substrate so as to cover the at least one IDT. ', '   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a surface acoustic wave apparatus for use in, for example, a resonator, band-pass filter, or other suitable device. In particular, the present invention relates to a surface acoustic wave apparatus using a rotated Y plate X-propagating LiTaO3 substrate and a method for manufacturing the same. 2. Description of the Related Art In mobile communication apparatuses, for example, cellular phones, surface acoustic wave filters have been used as RF stage band-pass filters and duplexers. As this sort of surface acoustic wave filter, a surface acoustic wave filter using a leaky surface acoustic wave has been used and includes an IDT (Interdigital Transducer) made of Al arranged on a 30 to 50-rotated Y plate X-propagating LiTaO3 substrate. However, this surface acoustic wave filter has a poor frequency temperature characteristic of 30 ppm/ C. to 40 ppm/ C. and, therefore, improvements thereto are required. In order to improve the frequency temperature characteristic, a structure has been suggested, in which an IDT made of Al has been formed on the 30 to 50-rotated Y plate X-propagating LiTaO3 substrate and, thereafter, a SiO2 film has been further laminated. The frequency temperature characteristic is improved by the arrangement of the SiO2 film. When the IDT made of Al is formed, the electrode film thickness H/&lgr; (H denotes a film thickness and &lgr; denotes a wavelength of a surface acoustic wave) of the IDT is significantly increased to 0.08 to 0.10 in order to increase the reflection coefficient and electromechanical coefficient K2. Since the IDT made of Al was allowed to have a significant thickness as described above, regarding the portion shown in FIG. 18A, when the SiO2 film was formed thereon in order to improve the frequency temperature characteristic, large height differences occurred in the SiO2 film and, thereby, cracks sometimes occurred in the SiO2 film as shown in FIG. 18B. Consequently, the filter characteristics of the surface acoustic wave filter were degraded due to the occurrence of the cracks. In addition, since the electrode film thickness of the IDT made of Al is large, an effect of covering the differences in the electrode surface of the IDT based on the arrangement of the SiO2 film was not adequate and, thereby, the temperature characteristic was not always improved adequately. Furthermore, the attenuation constant was increased due to the arrangement of the SiO2 film and, thereby, degradation of the filter characteristics occurred. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In order to overcome the problems described above, preferred embodiments of the present invention provide a surface acoustic wave apparatus and a method for manufacturing the same, wherein the surface acoustic wave apparatus includes a rotated Y plate X-propagating LiTaO3 substrate having a unique arrangement of a SiO2 film such that the frequency temperature characteristic is greatly improved, the electrode film thickness of the IDT can be significantly reduced, cracking in the SiO2 film is prevented and, furthermore, the attenuation constant is reduced by a large degree, so that targeted electrical characteristics, for example, desired filter characteristics, can be attained, and the electromechanical coefficient and reflection coefficient in the IDT are allowed to have adequate values. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a surface acoustic wave apparatus includes a LiTaO3 substrate having Euler angles (03, 113 to 136, 03), at least one IDT which is arranged on the LiTaO3 substrate and which primarily includes Cu, and a SiO2 film arranged on the LiTaO3 substrate to cover the at least one IDT. In preferred embodiments of the present invention, since the IDT primarily includes Cu, and the SiO2 film is arranged in a unique manner, the electromechanical coefficient is increased, and the frequency temperature characteristic is improved. Furthermore, since the LiTaO3 substrate having the specific desired Euler angles is used, the attenuation constant &agr; is greatly reduced.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The present invention will be made clear by describing specific preferred embodiments of the present invention below with reference to the drawings. FIG. 1 is a plan view for explaining a longitudinally coupled resonator filter as a surface acoustic wave apparatus according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. A surface acoustic wave apparatus 11 has a structure in which IDTs 13a and 13b and reflectors 14a and 14b are arranged on the top surface of a LiTaO3 substrate 12. A SiO2 film 15 is arranged so as to cover the IDTs 13a and 13b and reflectors 14a and 14b. As the LiTaO3 substrate 12, a 23 to 46-rotated Y plate LiTaO3 substrate is preferably used. With rotated Y plate X-propagating LiTaO3 substrates having cut angles outside this range, attenuation constants are increased and TCFs are degraded. The IDTs 13a and 13b and reflectors 14a and 14b are preferably made of Cu having a density higher than that of Al. Since the IDTs 13a and 13b and reflectors 14a and 14b are preferably made of Cu having a density that is higher than that of Al as described above, even when the film thicknesses of the IDTs 13a and 13b and reflectors 14a and 14b are reduced compared with those in the case where Al is used, the electromechanical coefficient and the reflection coefficient can be increased. FIG. 16 is a diagram showing the relationship between the reflectance on an electrode digit basis and the electrode film thickness of a Cu electrode and an Al electrode when the normalized film thickness of a SiO2 film is about 0.20. As shown in FIG. 16, when the electrode made of Cu is used, the reflectance on an electrode digit basis can be increased compared with that of the conventionally used electrode made of Al and, therefore, the number of digits in the reflector can be reduced. Consequently, miniaturization of the reflector and, by extension, miniaturization of the surface acoustic wave apparatus can be achieved. Since the electrode film thickness can be reduced as described above, the occurrence of cracks due to height differences of the SiO2 film 15 arranged on the IDTs 13a and 13b is reliably prevented. Regarding the thickness of the SiO2 film 15, as is clear from experimental examples described later, the film thickness H/&lgr; normalized by the wavelength of the surface acoustic wave is preferably within the range of about 0.15 to about 0.40. When the film thickness falls within this range, the attenuation constant can be decreased by a large degree compared with that in the case where the SiO2 film is not arranged and, therefore, reduction of loss can be achieved. As described later, the film thicknesses H/&lgr; normalized by the wavelength of the surface acoustic wave of the IDTs 13a and 13b are preferably about 0.01 to about 0.08. In the surface acoustic wave apparatus according to preferred embodiments of the present invention, as described above, since the IDTs 13a and 13b are made of Cu on the LiTaO3 substrate 12, the electrode film thicknesses of the IDTs 13a and 13b can be decreased. Consequently, the occurrence of height differences in the SiO2 film is reliably prevented, and cracking is also reliably prevented. Furthermore, since the LiTaO3 substrate having specific Euler angles is used, the attenuation constant can be reduced by a large degree, and reduction of loss can be achieved. In addition, excellent frequency temperature characteristics can be achieved by arrangement of the SiO2 film 15. This will be described based on the specific experimental examples. Surface acoustic waves which propagate through the LiTaO3 substrate include a leaky surface acoustic wave (LSAW) other than a Rayleigh wave. The leaky surface acoustic wave has a large sound velocity and a large electromechanical coefficient compared with those of the Rayleigh wave, and propagates while releasing energy in the substrate. Consequently, the leaky surface acoustic wave has an attenuation constant which causes propagation loss. FIG. 3 shows the relationship between the &thgr; of the Euler angles (0, &thgr;, 0) and the attenuation constant &agr; when the substrate surface is electrically short-circuited regarding the rotated Y plate X-propagating LiTaO3 substrate. There is a relationship in which the rotation angle is substantially equal to &thgr;-90. As is clear from FIG. 3, the attenuation constant &agr; is small when the &thgr; of the Euler angles is within the range of about 124 to about 126, and the attenuation constant &agr; is increased outside this range. It is known that in the case where an IDT made of Al having relatively large thickness is used, the attenuation constant becomes small when the &thgr; is about 129 to about 136. Therefore, conventionally, when the IDT made of Al was used, a LiTaO3 substrate in which the &thgr; of the Euler angles was within the range of about 129 to about 136 was used. FIG. 2 shows the relationship between the &thgr; of the Euler angles and the electromechanical coefficient K2. As is clear from FIG. 2, a large electromechanical coefficient K2 can be achieved when the &thgr; of the Euler angles is within the range of about 100 to about 120. However, as is clear from FIG. 3, since the attenuation constant &agr; is large when the &thgr; is within the range of about 100 to about 120, the LiTaO3 substrate having a &thgr; of about 100 to about 120 cannot be used for the surface acoustic wave apparatus. FIG. 4 shows the relationship between the normalized film thickness H/&lgr; of a Cu film and the electromechanical coefficient K2 when an IDT made of Cu is arranged on a 36-rotated Y plate X-propagating LiTaO3 substrate (Euler angles (0, 126, 0)). Here, &lgr; denotes a wavelength at a center frequency of a surface acoustic wave apparatus. As is clear from FIG. 4, when the film thickness H/&lgr; of the Cu film is within the range of about 0.01 to about 0.10, the electromechanical coefficient K2 is approximately 1.5 times or more than that in the case where no Cu film is arranged (H/&lgr;&equals;0), when the film thickness H/&lgr; of the Cu film is within the range of about 0.02 to about 0.08, the electromechanical coefficient K2 takes on a value that is approximately 1.8 times or more than that in the case where no Cu film is arranged, and when the film thickness H/&lgr; of the Cu film is within the range of about 0.03 to about 0.06, the electromechanical coefficient K2 takes on a value that is approximately 2 times or more than that in the case where no Cu film is arranged. Furthermore, the electromechanical coefficient K2 takes on a maximum value at a small film thickness H/&lgr; on the order of about 0.04 compared with that of Al used conventionally, and the value is larger than that of Al. When the normalized film thickness H/&lgr; of the Cu film exceeds approximately 0.08, manufacture of an IDT made of the Cu film becomes difficult. Consequently, in order that a large electromechanical coefficient can be achieved, and the IDT is manufactured with ease, the thickness of the IDT made of the Cu film is desirably within the range of about 0.01 to about 0.08, more preferably, is specified to be within the range of about 0.02 to about 0.08, and further preferably, be within the range of about 0.03 to about 0.06. Changes in the temperature coefficient of resonant frequency TCF when a SiO2 film is arranged on a LiTaO3 substrate are shown in FIG. 5. FIG. 5 shows the relationship between the normalized film thickness H/&lgr; of the SiO2 film and the TCF when SiO2 films are arranged on three types of LiTaO3 substrate, each having Euler angles (0, 113, 0), (0, 126, 0), or (0, 129, 0). No electrode is provided in this case. As is clear from FIG. 5, in each of the cases where the angle &thgr; is 113, 126, and 129, the TCF falls within the range of about 20 to about &plus;17 ppm/ C. when the normalized film thickness H/&lgr; of the SiO2 film is within the range of about 0.15 to about 0.45. However, since film formation of the SiO2 film takes much time, the film thickness H/&lgr; of the SiO2 film is preferably about 0.15 to about 0.40. It has been known that the TCFs of the Rayleigh wave, etc., have been improved by arrangement of the SiO2 film on the LiTaO3 substrate. However, regarding a structure in which the electrode made of Cu is arranged on the LiTaO3 substrate, and the SiO2 film is further laminated, it has not been reported that any actual experiment was performed in consideration of the thickness of the electrode made of Cu, the film thickness of the SiO2, the cut angle, and the attenuation constant of the leaky elastic wave. FIG. 6 shows changes in the attenuation constant &agr; when an electrode made of Cu having a normalized film thickness H/&lgr; of about 0.10 or less and a SiO2 film having a normalized film thickness H/&lgr; of about 0 to about 0.5 are arranged on a LiTaO3 substrate having Euler angles (0, 120, 0). As is clear from FIG. 6, when the film thickness H/&lgr; of the SiO2 film is about 0.2 to about 0.40, and the film thickness H/&lgr; of the Cu film is about 0.01 to about 0.10, the attenuation constant &agr; becomes small. On the other hand, FIG. 7 shows changes in the attenuation constant &agr; when a Cu film having a normalized film thickness H/&lgr; of about 0 to about 0.10 is arranged on a LiTaO3 substrate having Euler angles (0, 135, 0), and a SiO2 film having a normalized film thickness H/&lgr; of about 0 to about 0.5 is further arranged. As is clear from FIG. 7, in the case where the LiTaO3 substrate having the &thgr; of 135 is used, even when the film thickness of the Cu film and the film thickness of the SiO2 film are changed as described above, the attenuation constants &agr; are large. Consequently, it is clear that in order to realize an excellent TCF, a large electromechanical coefficient, and a small attenuation constant, the cut angle of the LiTaO3 substrate, that is, the Euler angles, the film thickness of the SiO2 film, and the film thickness of the electrode made of Cu must be combined while each of them is adjusted to be optimum. Each of FIGS. 8 to 15 shows the relationship between the &thgr; and the attenuation constant &agr; when a Cu film having a normalized film thickness H/&lgr; of about 0.08 or less is arranged on a LiTaO3 substrate while the normalized film thickness H/&lgr; of a SiO2 film is approximately 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.35, 0.4 or 0.45. As is clear from FIGS. 8 to 15, in the case where the thickness H/&lgr; of the Cu film is about 0.01 to about 0.08, when the thickness of the SiO2 film and the &thgr; of the Euler angles are chosen as shown in the following Table 5, the frequency temperature characteristic TCF becomes excellent, the electromechanical coefficient is greatly increased, and the attenuation constant &agr; can be effectively controlled. Desirably, further excellent characteristics can be achieved when more preferable Euler angles shown in the right column of the following Table 5 are chosen.           TABLE 5      SiO2 film thickness Euler angles of LiTaO3 More preferably        0.15 to 0.18 (0, 117 to 137, 0) (0, 120 to 135, 0)   0.18 to 0.23 (0, 117 to 136, 0) (0, 118 to 133, 0)   0.23 to 0.28 (0, 115 to 135, 0) (0, 117 to 133, 0)   0.28 to 0.33 (0, 113 to 133, 0) (0, 115 to 132, 0)   0.33 to 0.38 (0, 113 to 135, 0) (0, 115 to 133, 0)   0.38 to 0.4 (0, 113 to 132, 0) (0, 115 to 130, 0)           As is clear from FIG. 2, when the &thgr; of the Euler angles become about 125 or less, the electromechanical coefficient K2 is increased by a large degree. Consequently, it is clear that the combinations of the normalized film thicknesses of the SiO2 film and the Euler angles shown in the following Table 6 are more preferable.            TABLE 6        SiO2 film thickness Euler angles of LiTaO3          0.15 to 0.18 (0, 117 to 125, 0)    0.18 to 0.23 (0, 117 to 125, 0)    0.23 to 0.28 (0, 115 to 125, 0)    0.28 to 0.33 (0, 113 to 125, 0)    0.33 to 0.38 (0, 113 to 125, 0)    0.38 to 0.40 (0, 113 to 125, 0)            Furthermore, Euler angles, that is, the &thgr;min, at which the attenuation constant became 0 or minimum were determined with respect to the normalized film thickness hs of a SiO2 film and the normalized film thickness H/&lgr; of a Cu film from the results shown in FIG. 5 to FIG. 14, and the results thereof are shown in FIG. 17. Regarding the cases where the normalized film thicknesses H/&lgr; of the Cu film are approximately 0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, and 0.08, each of the curves shown in FIG. 17 is approximated by a cubic polynomial and, therefore, the following Formulae A to E are obtained. (a) when 0<H/&lgr;&lE;0.01 &thgr;min&equals;139.713hs3&plus;43.07132hs220.568011hs&plus;125.8314Formula A (b) when 0.01<H/&lgr;&lE;0.03 &thgr;min&equals;139.660hs3&plus;46.02985hs221.141500hs&plus;127.4181Formula B (c) when 0.03<H/&lgr;&lE;0.05 &thgr;min&equals;139.607hs3&plus;48.98838hs221.714900hs&plus;129.0048Formula C (d) when 0.05<H/&lgr;&lE;0.07 &thgr;min&equals;112.068hs3&plus;39.60355hs221.186000hs&plus;129.9397Formula D (e) when 0.07<H/&lgr;&lE;0.09 &thgr;min&equals;126.954hs3&plus;67.40488hs229.432000hs&plus;131.5686Formula E Consequently, the &thgr; of the Euler angles (0, &thgr;, 0) is desirably specified to be the &thgr;min represented by the Formulae A to E. Furthermore, when &thgr;min2<&thgr;&lE;&thgr;min&plus;2 is satisfied, the attenuation constant can be effectively reduced. In preferred embodiments of the present invention, the IDT may be composed of Cu alone, or may be composed of a Cu alloy or a laminate of Cu and other metal as long as Cu is primarily included. It is preferred that the IDT primarily including Cu satisfies the following: &rgr;(Cu)0.7&lE;&rgr;(average)&lE;&rgr;(Cu)1.3 that is, 6.25 g/cm3&lE;&rgr;(average)&lE;11.6 g/cm3, where the average density of the electrode is denoted by &rgr;(average). An electrode made of a metal, for example, W, Ta, Au, Pt, Ag, and Cr, having a density larger than that of Al may be laminated on or under the Cu in order that the &rgr;(average) of the total electrode falls within the aforementioned range. In that case as well, effects similar to those in the case of a single layer of the Cu electrode can be achieved. In the above-described experiment, the LiTaO3 substrate having Euler angles (0, &thgr;, 0) was used. In general, variations of about 03 occur regarding the Euler angles of the substrate material. However, the effects of preferred embodiments of the present invention can be achieved even within the range of such variations, that is, regarding the LiTaO3 substrate of approximately (03, 113 to 136, 03). The present invention can be applied to not only the longitudinally coupled resonator type surface acoustic wave filter shown in FIG. 1, but also various surface acoustic wave apparatuses, for example, surface acoustic wave resonators, transversely coupled surface acoustic wave filters, ladder filters, and lattice filters. In the surface acoustic wave apparatus according to preferred embodiments of the present invention, since at least one IDT primarily including Cu is arranged on the LiTaO3 substrate having Euler angles (03, 113 to 136, 03), and the SiO2 film is arranged on the LiTaO3 substrate while covering the IDT, the surface acoustic wave apparatus having a large electromechanical coefficient, excellent temperature characteristics, a reduced attenuation constant &agr;, and a reduced propagation loss can be provided. In preferred embodiments of the present invention, when the film thickness normalized by the wavelength of the surface acoustic wave of the IDT is within the range of about 0.01 to about 0.08, and the normalized film thickness of the SiO2 film is within the range of about 0.15 to about 0.40, the electromechanical coefficient can be further increased, and excellent temperature characteristics can be realized. Furthermore, when the film thickness H/&lgr; of the IDT is about 0.01 to about 0.08, and the &thgr; of the Euler angles of the LiTaO3 substrate and the normalized film thickness H/&lgr; of the SiO2 are chosen as shown in Table 1, and more preferably, in Table 2, the surface acoustic wave apparatus having a larger electromechanical coefficient, further reduced attenuation constant &agr;, and further excellent frequency temperature characteristic can be provided. When the &thgr; of the Euler angles (0, &thgr;, 0) of the LiTaO3 substrate is more than about &thgr;min2, but less than about &thgr;min&plus;2, the attenuation constant is further reduced. Consequently, the propagation loss can be further reduced. It should be understood that the foregoing description is only illustrative of the present invention.

Field of the Invention This invention relates generally to a surface acoustic wave (SAW) reflector filter and, more particularly, to a SAW reflector filter employing dual tracks each including an input transducer, an output transducer and at least one reflector, where the reflectors have reflection functions that are equal in magnitude and opposite in phase so that the reflected waves combine at the output transducers. 2. Discussion of the Related Art Surface acoustic wave (SAW) filters for use in mobile phone communications systems are designed to be small in size, exhibit good out-of-bandwidth rejection, and provide narrow bandwidths with steep transition edges. Conventional SAW filters include an input transducer and an output transducer formed on a piezoelectric substrate. The input transducer is electrically excited with the electrical input signal that is to be filtered. The input transducer converts the electrical input signal to surface acoustic waves, such as Rayleigh waves, lamb waves, etc., that propagate along the substrate to the output transducer. The output transducer converts the acoustic waves to a filtered electrical signal. The input and output transducers typically include interdigital electrodes formed on the top surface of the substrate. The shape and spacing of the electrodes determine the center frequency and the band shape of the acoustic waves produced by the input transducer. Generally, the smaller the width of the electrodes, or the number of electrodes per wavelength, the higher the operating frequency. The amplitude of the surface acoustic waves at a particular frequency is determined by the constructive interference of the acoustic waves generated by the transducers. The combined length of the transducers determines the length of the overall filter. To design a conventional SAW filter with ideal filter characteristics, the filter&apos;s impulse response needs to be very long. Because the length of the impulse response is directly proportional to the length of the transducer, the overall length of a conventional SAW filter having ideal characteristics would be too long to be useful in mobile phone communication systems. Reflective SAW filters have been developed to satisfy this problem. Reflective SAW filters generally have at least one input transducer, one output transducer and one reflector formed on a piezoelectric substrate. The reflector is typically a reflective grating including spaced apart grid lines defining gaps therebetween. The acoustic waves received by the reflector from the input transducer are reflected by the grid lines within the grating so that the reflected waves constructively and destructively interfere with each other and the wave path is folded. The constructively interfered waves are reflected back to the output transducer having a particular phase. Because of the folding, the length of the transducer is no longer dependent on the duration of the impulse response. Reflective SAW filters are, therefore, smaller in size and have high frequency selectivity, and thus are desirable for mobile phone communications systems. The frequency response of a reflective SAW filter is further improved by weighting the individual reflectors to achieve a desired net reflectivity. The frequency response sets the phase and magnitude of the reflected acoustic waves. Existing weighting methods include position-weighting, omission-weighting and strip-width weighting. Other methods of weighting reflectors include changing the lengths of open-circuited reflective strips within an open-short reflector structure. Weighting the reflector helps to reduce the physical size of the filter and to improve the filter&apos;s frequency response. FIG. 1 is a top plan view of a known dual track SAW reflector filter 10 including a first track 12 and a second track 14. The first track 12 includes a bi-directional input interdigital transducer 16, a bi-directional output interdigital transducer 18, a first reflector 20 positioned on one side of the input transducer 16 and a second reflector 22 positioned on an opposite side of the output transducer 18, all formed on a piezoelectric substrate 24, as shown. Likewise, the second track 14 includes a bi-directional input interdigital transducer 28, a bi-directional output interdigital transducer 30, a first reflector 32 positioned on one side of the input transducer 28 and a second reflector 34 positioned on an opposite side of the output transducer 30, all formed on the piezoelectric substrate 24, as shown. The reflectors 20, 22, 32 and 34 can be any one of a number of suitable reflector devices, such as a reflective grating including a series of grid lines. The interdigital transducers 16, 18, 28 and 30 include a plurality of uniformly spaced interdigital electrode fingers 38 attached at opposite ends by bus bars 40. An electrical input signal to be filtered is applied to the input transducers 16 and 28 on an input line 42. The input transducers 16 and 28 convert the electric signal into surface acoustic waves that propagate outward from the input transducers 16 and 28 along a top surface of the substrate 24. Some of the acoustic waves from the input transducer 16 are directed towards the reflector 20 and some of the acoustic waves from the input transducer 16 are directed towards the output transducer 18 and the reflector 22. Likewise, some of the acoustic waves from the input transducer 28 are directed towards the reflector 32 and some of the acoustic waves from the input transducer 28 are directed towards the output transducer 30 and the reflector 34. The reflectors 20, 22, 32 and 34 are tuned to the wavelength &lgr; at the center frequency of the frequency band of interest that is to be filtered, and have the same length L1. The reflected waves from the reflectors 20 and 22 are directed back to the output transducer 18 and the reflected waves from the reflectors 32 and 34 are directed back to the output transducer 30 where they are converted to a filtered electrical signal on a common output line 36. The input transducer 16 and the output transducer 18 are spaced the same distance apart (L3) as the input transducer 28 and the output transducer 30. Also, the output transducers 18 and 30 have opposite polarities. Therefore, the surface acoustic waves directly received by the output transducer 18 from the input transducer 16 are 180 out of phase with the surface acoustic waves directly received by the output transducer 30 from the input transducer 28. Hence, these waves cancel on the output line 36 and will not be converted into electrical signal at the output transducers 18 and 30. These waves pass through the output transducers 18 and 30 with little attenuation and are reflected by the reflector 22 in the track 12 and the reflector 34 in the track 14, respectively. It is necessary to prevent cancellation of the reflected acoustic waves from the reflectors 20, 22, 32 and 34 on the output line 36. The reflectors 20 and 32 and the reflectors 22 and 34 are thus offset relative to each other by &lgr;/4. Particularly, the distance between the input transducer 16 and the reflector 20 and the distance between the output transducer 18 and the reflector 22 is L2. However, the distance between the input transducer 28 and the reflector 32 and the distance between the output transducer 30 and the reflector 34 is L2&plus;&lgr;/4. Thus, the acoustic waves reflected by the reflectors 20 and 32 travel a different distance to the transducers 18 and 30, respectively, by &lgr;/2, and are thus 180 out of phase with each other when they reach the output transducers 18 and 30. In other words, the acoustic waves in the second track 14 are delayed relative to the acoustic waves in the first track 12. Therefore, the output signals add on the output line 36. Likewise, the acoustic waves reflected by the reflectors 22 and 34 travel a different distance to the output transducers 18 and 30, respectively, by &lgr;/2, and thus are out of phase with each other when they reach the output transducers 18 and 30. Therefore, these signals also add on the output line 36. Hence, only reflected acoustic waves are provided on the output line 36. FIG. 2 is a top plan view of a known SAW filter 50, similar to the filter 10 discussed above, including a first track 52 and a second track 54. In this embodiment, each of the transducers and reflectors are tapered to accommodate a series of contiguous communications channels. Particularly, the first track 52 includes a tapered bi-directional input interdigital transducer 56, a tapered bi-directional interdigital output transducer 58, a first tapered reflector 60 adjacent to the input transducer 56 and a second tapered reflector 62 adjacent to the output transducer 58, all formed on a piezoelectric substrate 64. Likewise, the second track 54 includes a tapered bi-directional input interdigital transducer 68, a tapered bi-directional output interdigital transducer 70, a first tapered reflector 72 adjacent to the input transducer 68 and a second tapered reflector 74 adjacent to the output transducer 70 and opposite to the input transducer 68, all formed on the substrate 64. The reflectors 60, 62, 72 and 74 and the transducers 56, 58, 68 and 70 are tapered, or have varying grating and finger widths, so that the filter 50 becomes a relatively wide fractional bandwidth filter, as is well understood in the art. The input transducers 56 and 68 are coupled to a common input line 76 and the output transducers 58 and 70 are coupled to a common output line 78. As above, the reflectors 60 and 72 and the reflectors 62 and 74 are offset relative to each other by &lgr;/4 so that the reflected wave signals are out of phase with each other when they reach the output transducers 58 and 70, and thus add on the output line 78. Also, as above, the direct waves from the input transducer 56 to the output transducer 58 at the first track 52 cancel the direct wave from the input transducer 68 to the output transducer 70 at the second track 54. FIG. 3 is a top plan view of another known dual track SAW reflector filter 90, and is particularly disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,661,444 issued Aug. 26, 1997 to Dill et al. The SAW filter 90 includes a first track 92 and a second track 94. The first track 92 includes an input single phase unidirectional transducer (SPUDT) 96, an output SPUDT 98 and a reflector 100 positioned between the SPUDTs 96 and 98, all formed on a piezoelectric substrate 102, as shown. Likewise, the second track 94 includes an input SPUDT 106, an output SPUDT 108 and a reflector 110 positioned between the SPUDTs 106 and 108, all formed on the substrate 102, as shown. The input SPUDTs 96 and 106 are electrically coupled to a common input line 112 and the output SPUDTs 98 and 108 are electrically coupled to a common output line 114. The electrical signal to be filtered is applied to the input line 112 and causes the SPUDT 96 to generate unidirectional surface acoustic waves that propagate along the substrate 102 towards the reflector 100, where they are reflected within the grating structure of the reflector 100 to provide the longer impulse response and phase control. Likewise, the electrical signal on the line 112 applied to the SPUDT 106 generates unidirectional surface acoustic waves that propagate along the piezoelectric substrate 102 towards the reflector 110 to be reflected therein. Reflections within the grating structure of the reflectors 100 and 110 provide signal cancellation and propagation to provide a transmission wave that is phase controlled. The surface acoustic waves that are phase controlled by the reflector 100 are received by the output SPUDT 98 and the surface acoustic waves that are phase controlled by the reflector 110 are received by the output SPUDT 108. Because the output SPUDTs 98 and 108 have opposite polarities, if the distance between the SPUDT 96 and the SPUDT 98 was the same as the distance between the SPUDT 106 and the SPUDT 108, and the reflectors 100 and 110 were the same length and had the same phase properties, the signals would cancel on the output line 114. To prevent this signal cancellation, the &apos;444 patent proposes making the reflectors 100 and 110 different lengths so that the acoustic waves in the track 94 are delayed relative to the surface acoustic waves in the track 92 so that they add at the output line 114. It is noted that the reflector 100 is centered between the SPUDTs 96 and 98 and the reflector 110 is centered between the SPUDTs 106 and 108. In this example, the reflector 110 has a length L3 and the reflector 100 has a length L3&lgr;/2. Therefore, the surface acoustic waves from the SPUDT 106 received by the SPUDT 108 are delayed by &lgr;/2 relative to the surface acoustic waves generated by the SPUDT 96 and received by the SPUDT 98. Because of this delay, the surface acoustic waves received by the SPUDTs 98 and 108 are out of phase with each other when they reach the output SPUDTs 98 and 108, respectively, and thus add on the output line 114. There are two fundamental problems with the SAW reflector filter 90. First, for optimum performance, the reflector grating reflectivity of the reflectors 100 and 110 can only reflect 50% of the SAW energy from the SPUDTs 96 and 106, and thus only 50% of the useful energy is transmitted from the SPUDTs 96 and 106 through the reflectors 100 and 110 to the output SPUDTs 98 and 108, respectively. The ideal insertion loss of the filter 90 is 6 dB. If other secondary effects, such as propagation loss, resistive loss, diffraction loss, matching circuit loss, etc., are included, the insertion loss of a realistic device will be about 10 dB or more. Secondly, the configuration of the filter 90 provides multiple spurious responses in the time domain after the main signal due to the multiple reflections of the acoustic waves between the SPUDTs 96 and 106 and the reflector gratings 100 and 110. These multiple spurious signals are undesirable because they cause large passband ripples and group delay ripples in the frequency domain. These multiple reflections are most prominent when the insertion loss is matched to the lowest level by the external matching circuits. FIG. 4 is a top plan view of a known dual track SAW reflector filter 120 of the type disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,896,072 issued Apr. 20, 1999 to Bergman et al. The SAW filter 120 includes a first track 122 and a second track 124. The first track 122 includes a bi-directional input interdigital transducer 126, a reflector 128 positioned on one side of the transducer 126 and an output SPUDT 130 positioned on an opposite side of the transducer 126, all formed on a piezoelectric substrate 132. Likewise, the second track 124 includes a bi-directional input interdigital transducer 134, a reflector 136 positioned on one side of the transducer 134 and an output SPUDT 138 positioned on an opposite side of the transducer 134, all formed on the substrate 132, as shown. The transducers 126 and 134 are coupled to a common input line 140 and the SPUDTs 130 and 138 are coupled to a common output line 142. The transducers 126 and 134 have the same polarity and the SPUDTs 130 and 138 have opposite polarities. In this embodiment, the input transducer 126 and the output SPUDT 130 are the same distance apart (L4) as the input transducer 134 and the output SPUDT 138. Therefore, the acoustic waves received by the SPUDTs 130 and 138 directly from the input transducers 126 and 134, respectfully, are in phase, and thus cancel on the output line 142 because the SPUDTs 130 and 138 have opposite polarities. However, the distance between the input transducer 126 and the reflector 128 is L2 and the distance between the input transducer 134 and the reflector 136 is L2&plus;&lgr;/4. Therefore, the surface acoustic waves reflected by the reflectors 128 and 136 are out of phase with each other when they reach the SPUDTs 130 and 138, respectively, and thus add on the output line 142 because the SPUDTs 130 and 138 have opposite polarities. There is one fundamental problem with the reflector filter 120 that limits its performance. In order to design a low loss filter using this configuration, the SPUDTs 130 and 138 must be strong. However, strong reflections from the SPUDTs 130 and 138 also results in a strong spurious response in the time domain after the main signal due to the multiple reflections between the SPUDTs 130 and 138 and the reflectors 128 and 136, respectively. This spurious response is undesirable because it causes large passband ripples and group delay ripples in the frequency domain. The spurious response is most prominent when the insertion loss is matched to the lowest level by the external matching circuits. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the teachings of the present invention, a dual track SAW reflector filter is disclosed. The filter includes a first track having a first input transducer, a first output transducer, a first reflector and a second reflector. The filter further includes a second track having a second input transducer, a second output transducer, a third reflector and a fourth reflector. The distance between the input transducer and the output transducer in the first track is the same as the distance between the input transducer and the output transducer in the second track. The distance between the first input transducer and the first reflector in the first track, the distance between the first output transducer and the second reflector in the first track, the distance between the second input transducer and the third reflector in the second track and the distance between the second output transducer and the fourth reflector in the second track is the same. Also, the length of all the reflectors is the same. In an alternate embodiment, the first track and the second track may include only one reflector. The reflectivity function of the first reflector in the first track and the third reflector in the second track are equal in magnitude and opposite in phase. The reflectivity function of the second reflector in the first track and the fourth reflector in the second track are also equal in magnitude and opposite in phase. The input transducers have the same polarity and the output transducers have opposite polarities. Surface acoustic waves produced by the input transducers and received directly by the output transducers are in phase with each other when they reach the output transducers, and thus cancel on a common output line electrically coupled to both of the output transducers. The acoustic waves then pass through the output transducers with little attenuation and reach the third reflector in the first track and the fourth reflector in the second track. Surface acoustic waves produced by the first input transducer, reflected by the first reflector and received by the first output transducer in the first track are 180 out of phase with surface acoustic waves produced by the second input transducer, reflected by the third reflector and received by the second output transducer in the second track, and thus combine on the common output line. Surface acoustic waves produced by the first input transducer, reflected by the second reflector and received by the first output transducer in the first track are 180 out of phase with surface acoustic waves produced by the second input transducer, reflected by the fourth reflector and received by the second output transducer in the second track, and thus also combine on the common output line. Additional advantages and features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description and appended claims, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The following discussion of the embodiments of the invention directed to a dual track SAW reflector filter is merely exemplary in nature, and is in no way intended to limit the invention or its application or uses. FIG. 5 is a top plan view of a dual track SAW reflector filter 150, according to an embodiment of the present invention. The filter 150 includes a first track 152 and a second track 154. The first track 152 includes a bi-directional input interdigital transducer 156 and a bi-directional output interdigital transducer 158. The first track 152 further includes a first reflector 160 positioned on one side of the input transducer 156 and a second reflector 162 positioned on an opposite side of the output transducer 158. Likewise, the second track 154 includes a bi-directional input interdigital transducer 164 and a bi-directional output interdigital transducer 166. The second track 154 further includes a first reflector 168 positioned on one side of the input transducer 164 and a second reflector 170 positioned on an opposite side of the output transducer 166. All of the interdigital transducers 156, 158, 164 and 166 include electrode fingers 172 and opposing end bars 174 as is well known in the art. According to the invention, the interdigital transducers 156, 158, 164 and 166 can be replaced with any type of transducer suitable for a SAW reflector filter. For example, the transducers 156, 158, 164 and 166 can be single phase uni-directional transducers (SPUDT). In those embodiments that employ SPUDTs one set of the reflectors 160 and 168 or 162 and 170 can be eliminated. Also, in other embodiments that may employ interdigital transducers, only a single reflector in both of the tracks 152 and 154 may be used. The reflectors 160, 162, 168 and 170 can be any reflector structure suitable for an SAW reflector filter. For example, the reflectors 160, 162, 168 and 170 can be gratings including grid lines, where the grid lines have a predetermined spacing, such as distributed acoustic reflective gratings (DARG) and dithered reflector gratings (DIRG). Suitable reflective gratings are disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/376,802, filed Feb. 28, 2003 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/377,333, filed Feb. 28, 2003, both being filed concurrently herewith, assigned to the assignee of this application and herein incorporated by reference. The reflective gratings discussed in the &apos;802 application employs reflective dots on the grid lines and/or between the grid lines to provide the reflectivity function. The reflective gratings discussed in the &apos;333 application employ grid line dithering to provide the desired reflectivity. In one embodiment, the reflective grating has a repetitive sampling period each including a predetermined number of grid lines. The sampling period is defined by M grid lines per each N wavelength (N&lgr;/M), where &lgr; is the wavelength of the center frequency of the filter bandwidth, M and N are integers and M>N. Examples of sampling periods include, but are not limited to, &lgr;/4, &lgr;/3, &lgr;/5, 3&lgr;/7, 3&lgr;/8, 4&lgr;/7 and 5&lgr;/8. A characteristic of each sampling period is that uniformly spaced grid lines alone has no net reflectivity for M>N. A similar sampling period scheme can also apply to the input and output transducers. The reflectors 160, 162, 168 and 170 all have the same length L1. Further, the distance L2 between the reflector 160 and the input transducer 156, the reflector 162 and the output transducer 158, the reflector 168 and the input transducer 164 and the reflector 170 and the output transducer 166 is the same. Also, the distance L3 between the input transducer 156 and the output transducer 158 and the distance between the input transducer 164 and the output transducer 166 is the same. The input transducers 156 and 164 have the same polarity and are coupled to a common Input line 176. The output transducers 158 and 166 have opposite polarities and are coupled to a common output line 178. Therefore, the acoustic waves produced by the input transducer 156 and received directly by the output transducer 158 are in phase with the surface acoustic waves produced by the input transducer 164 and received directly by the output transducer 166, and thus cancel on the output line 178. According to the invention, in order to prevent the reflected acoustic waves from canceling in each track at the output transducers 158 and 166, the reflectors 160 and 162 and the reflectors 168 and 170 are mirror images of each other. In addition, the reflectivity functions of the reflector 160 and the reflector 168 are 180 out of phase with each other when observed from any point to the right of the right edge of the reflector 160 or 168 so that signals that reflect will add coherently in the two tracks. However, the magnitude of the reflectivity function of the reflectors 160 and 168 is the same. Likewise, the reflectivity functions of the reflectors 162 and 170 are 180 out of phase with each other when observed from any point to the left of the left edge of the reflector 162 or 170, but have the same magnitude. One skilled in the art would readily recognize how to pattern the grid lines in the reflectors 160, 162, 168 and 178 to provide the mirror images in phase discussed herein. The orientation of the various grid lines, reflective dots, dithered grid lines, etc., within the reflectors 160, 162, 168 and 170 would be properly designed to provide this function. As will be discussed in detail below, the surface acoustic waves reflected by the reflector 160 are 180 out of phase with the acoustic waves reflected by the reflector 168 when they reach the output transducers 158 and 166, respectively. Likewise, the surface acoustic waves reflected by the reflector 162 are 180 out of phase with the acoustic waves reflected the reflector 170 when they reach the output transducers 158 and 166, respectively. Therefore, only those acoustic waves that provide the desired long impulse response, i.e., those that reflect from a reflector, are converted into filtered electrical signals on the output line 178. Because the input transducer 156 is bi-directional, surface acoustic waves generated by the transducer 156 propagate in both directions. The surface acoustic waves generated by the input transducer 156 that are directly received by the output transducer 158 propagate on signal path 1A. The surface acoustic waves generated by the input transducer 156 that are received by the reflector 160, and are reflected therefrom to be received by the output transducer 158, propagate on signal path 1B. The surface acoustic waves generated by the input transducer 156 that are received by the reflector 162, and are reflected therefrom to be received by the output transducer 158, propagate on signal path 1C. The same signal paths for the track 154 are shown as 2A, 2B and 2C. Because the output transducers 158 and 166 have opposite polarities and the distance between the input transducer 156 and the output transducer 158 and the input transducer 164 and the output transducer 166 is the same, the surface acoustic waves on the signal paths 1A and 2A cancel on the output line 178. The surface acoustic waves on the signal paths 1A and 2A that propagate through the output transducers 158 and 166 propagate on the signal paths 1C and 2C. Because the reflectivity functions of the reflectors 162 and 170 are equal in magnitude and opposite in phase, the reflected acoustic waves on the signal path 1C are 180 out of phase with the reflected acoustic waves on the signal path 2C. When the surface acoustic waves on the signal paths 1C and 2Care received by the output transducers 158 and 166, respectively, they will be out of phase with each other, and thus will add on the output line 178 because the output transducers 158 and 166 have opposite polarities. Because the reflectors 160 and 168 are equal in magnitude and opposite in phase, the reflected acoustic waves on the signal paths 1B and 2B are 180 out of phase with each other. When the acoustic waves on the signal paths 1B and 2B arrive at the input transducers 156 and 164, respectively, the acoustic waves will be out of phase with each other because the input transducers 156 and 164 have the same polarity. Thus, the acoustic waves on the signal paths 1B and 2B will pass through the input transducers 156 and 164 to be received by the output transducers 158 and 166. Because the output transducers 158 and 166 have opposite polarities, the acoustic waves on the signal paths 1B and 2B will combine or add on the output line 178. Because of the symmetric arrangement of the reflectors 160, 162, 168 and 170 and the transducers 156, 158, 164 and 166, the surface acoustic waves on the signal paths 1B and 1C arrive at the output transducer 158 in phase and simultaneously, and the surface acoustic waves on the signal paths 2B and 2C arrive at the output transducer 166 in phase and simultaneously. Thus, all of the reflected surface acoustic waves on the signal paths 1B, 2B, 1C and 2C are in phase at the output transducers 158 and 166, and will be converted back to the filtered electrical signal on the output line 178 as a single signal. FIG. 6 is a top plan view of a dual track tapered SAW reflector filter 190, according to another embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, the signal paths of the surface acoustic waves add and subtract in the same manner as the filter 150 discussed above. However, as with the embodiment shown in FIG. 2, each of the various transducers and reflective gratings are tapered to create a filter with a wide fractional bandwidth. Particularly, the filter 190 includes a first track 192 and a second track 194. The first track 192 includes a tapered bi-directional input interdigital transducer 196 and a tapered bi-directional output interdigital transducer 198 that are both tapered to create a wide fractional bandwidth filter. Further, the first track 192 includes a first tapered reflector 200 and a second tapered reflector 202 that are tapered to create a wide fractional bandwidth filter. Likewise, the second track 194 includes a tapered bi-directional interdigital input transducer 204, a tapered bi-directional interdigital output transducer 206, a first tapered reflector 208 and a second tapered reflector 210. The tapered input transducers 196 and 204 are electrically coupled to a common input line 212 and the output transducers 198 and 206 are electrically coupled to a common output line 214. The present invention provides a number of advantages not found in the prior art. For example, the SAW reflector filter of the invention provides a wide range of sampling rates for different operating frequencies. A low sampling rate can be used for high frequency applications to improve fabrication yield when the critical dimension is important. A higher sampling rate can be used for lower frequency applications to provide more data samplings when the critical dimension is not important. More samplings per period will improve the accuracy of the gratings&apos; reflectivity function. Further, a 1.5 GHz operating frequency on ST-Quartz can be achieved using a 3&lgr;/5 or 4&lgr;/7 distributed acoustic reflective grating (DARG) provided that 0.6 &mgr;m is the smallest critical geometry. This is two times higher than any operating frequency ever achieved by a reflective grating device with the same critical geometry dimension on ST-Quartz. The low sampling rate means that the critical sampling dimension is much larger than other sampling rates at a given frequency, thus the large critical dimension can tolerate bigger fabrication error end results and higher fabrication yields. For those reflectors that are dithered reflective gratings (DIRGs), the DIRG reflectivity is a function of the reflector thickness and the amount of reflector dithering. Having a desirable amount of grating reflection can be achieved by varying the dithering pattern at different periods of the grating, thus providing a near analog implementation of reflectivity throughout the complete reflector. For those reflectors that are DARGs, the DARG reflectivity is a function of the reflector dot thickness and density. Any desirable amount of grating reflection can be achieved by varying reflective dot densities at different periods of the grating, thus providing near analog implementation of reflectivity throughout the transducer. Increasing the reflectivity strength does not change the critical dimension of the structure, and hence, does not lower the operating frequency or reduce the fabrication yield due to a smaller critical dimension. For those designs that can achieve 1.5 GHz operating frequency on ST-Quartz, only single level metal deposition is required. The single mask fabrication process guarantees a higher fabrication yield than dual mask fabrication processes, especially at high frequency when the critical dimension is small. The ideally matched response of the SAW reflector filters of the present invention does not provide multiple reflections after the main signal in the time domain. Thus, a low loss reflector filter with small passband ripples and group delay ripples can be provided. Also, a single channel narrow band width reflective filter of the current invention can be modified to design a wide fractional bandwidth. The foregoing discussion discloses and describes merely exemplary embodiments of the present invention. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from such discussion and from the accompanying drawings and claims that various changes, modifications and variations can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the following claims.

      "('06836198', '20041228', 'B2', '', 'Adjustable capacitive coupling structure', ' A cavity filter which provides for fine tuning of the bandwidth of the filter. The filter provides for both capacitive cross-coupling and inductive coupling between physically adjacent but electrically non-adjacent resonators in the filter. The isolation of the filter can be fine tuned by adjusting the inductive coupling between these resonators, which has the effect of attenuating the cross-coupling effect between these resonators. ', '   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention This invention relates to microwave frequency filters. More specifically, this invention relates to a microwave frequency cavity filter whose bandwidth can be precisely fine-tuned with a minimum of effort, expense, and service interruptions. Discussion of the Related Art The rapid growth in cellular telephony and wireless communications has created enormous demand for bandwidth in the microwave radio frequency spectrum. As wireless technologies that depend on the microwave spectrum have become more popular, the microwave portion of the radio spectrum has become more crowded. Unused microwave frequencies are occupied by wireless service providers as soon as they become available, forcing wireless communication firms operating in the same location to provide their services on adjacent frequencies, without the benefit of any empty bandwidth between them. Because of this congestion, wireless providers need a way to isolate the transmission and reception of their frequencies from neighboring frequencies that are used for other services or by other providers. To accomplish this frequency isolation, resonator filters have been developed. These filters are built to permit only the frequencies in a certain range to pass through. This frequency range is called the pass band, and the frequencies inside this range are called bandpass frequencies. The frequencies outside of the pass band fall into the stop bands, and are blocked by the filter. While a number of resonator filter designs have been developed, one of the most common filters for use in microwave communications is the cavity filter. This type of filter consists of a number of resonators placed inside physically adjacent hollow metal cavities, thereby forming cavity resonators. By inductively coupling two or more adjacent resonators, the bandpass frequencies of these resonators are combined, forming a resonator filter with a bandwidth encompassing a range of frequencies. But in order to properly block the undesired frequencies in the stop band of the filter, some physically adjacent resonators in the filter are capacitively cross-coupled, which effectively cancels out certain frequencies in the filter. Capacitive cross-coupling attenuates the slope of the frequency response curve of the filter between the edge of the pass band and the edge of the stop band, allowing the filter to more precisely match the desired pass band without also erroneously passing frequencies outside of the pass band that may be used for other signals or which may be owned by other service providers. In essence, adjusting the capacitive cross-coupling within the filter fine tunes the isolation of the filter. In this regard, capacitive cross-coupling and inductive coupling have the opposite effect on the signals passed between adjacent resonators. For this reason, conventional cavity filters do not employ both capacitive cross-coupling and inductive coupling between a given pair of resonators. In conventional cavity filters, the inductive coupling between adjacent resonators is accomplished by placing a gap in the wall separating the two cavities. The size of the gap determines the amount of coupling. A common method of providing the capacitive cross-coupling in these conventional filters is to extend a metal bar across the wall separating two electrically non-adjacent resonators. The length of the bar determines the capacitive cross-coupling. In order to precisely select the frequency cutoff of the filter between the pass band and the stop band, the cross-coupling bar must have very precise physical dimensions. Furthermore, in order to fine tune the filter for tolerance purposes, the physical length of the bar must be changed, either by means of a fine tuning screw at one end of the bar, or more commonly by replacing the bar with another one of different length. But adjustment of the capacitive cross-coupling by either means is cumbersome and impractical. First, conventional cavity filters used for microwave signals are quite large and are made entirely of metal with covers or lids made of lead that cover the resonator cavities as well as the cross-coupling bars. Replacing or adjusting the cross-coupling bar requires physically removing this lead cover, which is difficult and labor intensive. Furthermore, manufacturing the cross-coupling bars to the precise physical dimensions and tolerances required in conventional filters makes them expensive, which adds further to the overall cost of the filter. Given these problems with conventional filters as well as the increased need for precise tuning of filter bandwidth at low cost, what is needed is a cavity filter that can be manufactured at a reduced cost but whose bandwidth can be very precisely tuned and adjusted with a minimum of effort and without interruption of service. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention is directed to a cavity filter. According to a first aspect of the invention, the resonator comprises a filter housing having at least two cavities separated by a cavity wall; a filter cover for covering said filter housing; and a plurality of resonators respectively disposed in said cavities, wherein at least two of the resonators are coupled to each other by both an inductive coupler and a capacitive cross-coupler. Specifically, the capacitive cross-coupler includes a bar that extends from the cavity wall into each of the cavities and the inductive coupler is an opening in the cavity wall between the cavities. The inductive coupler also includes an adjustable fine tuner comprising a screw threaded through either the filter cover or the filter housing, such that the screw extends into the opening in the cavity wall. The invention is also directed to a method of fine tuning the slope of the frequency response curve of the cavity filter described above by attenuating the capacitive cross-coupling effect indirectly by adjusting the fine tuner of the inductive coupler. Specifically, the fine tuner is adjusted from the exterior of the filter by turning the screw further into the opening in the cavity wall, thereby increasing the inductance of the inductive coupler, reducing the capacitance between the two resonators. Similarly, by unscrewing the screw, it is retracted from the opening, reducing the inductance of the coupler and increasing the capacitance between the two resonators.     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The objects and advantages of the present invention will be made more clear with reference to the following drawings, in which like elements have been given like reference characters. In particular: FIG. 1 is a top view of a cavity filter of the present invention; FIG. 2 is a front view of a cavity wall of the cavity filter of the present invention which includes both capacitive cross-coupler and inductive coupler between the electrically non-adjacent resonators of FIG. 1; FIG. 3 is a sample frequency response curve of a cavity filter of the present invention; FIG. 4 is a front view of another alternate embodiment of the present invention showing the same cavity wall as FIG. 2 but with a different inductive coupler.,     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The preferred embodiment of the invention is described with reference to FIGS. 1 and 2, showing a four-cavity filter 100. According to a preferred embodiment, the resonator filter 100 includes a filter housing 102 and a filter cover 104. Provided in the housing 102 are a plurality of resonators 106, 108, 110, and 112. The resonators are inductively coupled in series such that resonator 106 is coupled to resonator 108, resonator 108 is coupled to resonator 110, and resonator 10 is coupled to resonator 112. These resonators are separated from each other by cavity walls 114, 116, 118, and 123 that form a cross-shaped arrangement. As shown in FIG. 1, walls 114, 116, and 118 extend only partially to the perimeter walls 120 of the filter housing 102 leaving a gap 122 therebetween. Hence, the walls permit inductive coupling between resonators 106-108; 108-110; and 110-112. On the other hand, it is preferable that cavity wall 123 extends all the way to the perimeter wall 120. This cavity wall 123 electrically separates the first resonator 106 in the series from the last resonator 112 in the series. Hence resonators 106 and 112 are not inductively coupled in the way that the other resonators are, and are therefore are not electrically adjacent in the series despite being physically adjacent. Because they are physically adjacent, resonators 106 and 112 can be capacitively cross-coupled using the cross-coupling bar 124. Referring to FIG. 3, the purpose of the cross-coupling bar 124 is to attenuate the slope 126 of the cutoff in the frequency response curve 128 between the pass band 130 and the stop bands 132 in FIG. 3. In order to fine tune this capacitive cross-coupling effect, the invention includes an inductive coupler in cavity wall 123 in the form of a notch 134 provided in cavity wall 123 and an associated fine tuning screw 136, shown in FIG. 2. The fine tuning screw 136 extends through the filter cover 104 into the notch 134. The capacitance cross-coupling effect can be changed by turning the screw from the exterior of the filter 100. More specifically, when the screw is turned so that it extends further into the notch 134 the inductance provided by the notch is raised thereby reducing the effective length of the cross-coupling bar 124 and, attendantly, the capacitive cross-coupling between resonators 106 and 112. Conversely, when the screw is turned in the opposite direction (i.e., to shorten the distance that the fine tuning screw 136 extends into the notch 134), the inductance provided by the notch is reduced thereby increasing the effective length of the cross-coupling bar 124, and, attendantly, the capacitive cross-coupling between resonators 106 and 112. Referring to FIG. 2, the filter cover 104 encloses the resonator cavity. According to the preferred embodiment, the filter cover 104 is made of lead, while the housing 102 is made of iron. Of course, the invention is not limited in this respect. The cross-coupling bar 124 is held in the cavity wall 123 by a collar 138, made of an electrically insulating material such as plastic. As noted above, the tuning screw 1136 extends through the filter cover 104 into the notch 134. While notch 134 can be of any height equal to or less than the height of wall 123, in the preferred embodiment the notch provides only fine adjustment of the capacitive effect of the cross-coupling bar 124. Therefore, the height of the notch is only between twenty and fifty percent of the height of the wall 123. Again, however, it should be understood that the invention is not limited to any particular height. FIG. 4 illustrates additional embodiment of the invention. In particular, in the embodiment of FIG. 4, both the bar 124 and the notch 134 are set in the middle of cavity wall 123. The tuning notch 134 is provided above the bar 124. This embodiment shows a filter which can be easily changed from one capacitive cross-coupling level to another by easily replacing the bar, but which also retains the ability to fine tune the bar 124 once it is set in place by adjusting the tuning screw 136 that extends through the top of the filter cover 104. More specifically, with this arrangement, the insulating collar 138 that holds the bar 124 in place can be easily removed by sliding it out through the slot 134. Having described the invention with particular reference to the preferred embodiments, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art to which the invention pertains after understanding the invention, that various modification s and changes may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the claims appended hereto.

Field of the Invention The present invention relates to an improvement of a tuning circuit using a negative resistance circuit in order to improve Q of the tuning circuit. 2. Description of the Related Art In a radio receiver, in order to improve frequency selectivity of a high frequency section thereof, there are methods to add a tuning amplifying section thereto or to use a negative resistance circuit. Further, the latter method contains a so-called reproduce receiving method wherein positive feedback is applied from an output of an amplifier to a tuning circuit section and a method to improve effective Q of a tuning circuit by adding a negative resistance circuit including a negative impedance converter, etc. to a tuning circuit.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS A tuning circuit of the present invention is constructed so as to compensate a series resistance component thereof by means of such construction that one side of a series resonance circuit having an inductor and a capacitor connected in series with each other is driven and other side thereof is earthed through a negative resistance circuit in order to keep pass band width and circuit gain constant even if a tuning frequency is changed. An output of the tuning circuit is taken out from a suitable point within the negative resistance circuit because said output is taken out from a connection point of the inductor and the capacitor as a voltage, so that the circuit gain thereof is changed by changing a tuning frequency. Its reason lies in that if a series resistance component is constant when a negative resistance circuit is used even if a tuning frequency is changed, a current flowing through the negative resistance circuit is constant. A negative resistance circuit can be realized by means of combination of a positive feedback circuit and a negative feedback circuit. However, a negative resistance circuit in the present invention includes a circuit having a differential input in first stage thereof and a low output impedance circuit such as an emitter follower in second stage to made it operate at a high frequency band. An output of the emitter follower is directly fed back to a same phase input side of the differential input and further is fed back to an inverse phase input side thereof, so that a negative resistor can be obtained at this inverse phase input terminal. FIG. 1 shows an embodiment of a tuning circuit of the present invention. Also, FIG. 2 shows an equivalent circuit for explaining operation of said embodiment. In FIG. 1, DRV is a driving circuit of the tuning circuit, V0 is a driving source voltage and R0 is an inside resistor thereof. C, L, R1 are a capacitor, an inductor and a series resistance component constituting a series resonance circuit M respectively, and 1, 2 is an input terminal of a negative resistance circuit N for compensating a series resistance component of R0 and R1. The negative resistance circuit N is constituted by three transistor circuits. Q1, Q2 are transistors constituting a differential amplifying circuit. A Q1 side is an inverse phase side, a Q2 side is a same phase side. Also, Q3 is an emitter follower circuit for providing a low output impedance and 3, 4 is an output terminal. FIG. 2 represents blocks indicating functions of the circuit of FIG. 1. In FIG. 2, since a reactance component is zero because the circuit is in a tuning point, a resistance component of R1 remains and thus R0&plus;1 is combination of this R1 and the inside resistor R0. The negative resistance circuit N consists of a subtracting circuit SUB, the amplifying circuit Q1, Q2 and a negative resistance value setting resistor R2 equivalently and A is an amplification factor of the amplifying circuit Q1, Q2 when R3&equals;R4. In FIG. 2, when the right side is seen from the terminal 1-2, the following equations exist.              V 2  -  V 1    R 2   = 0     ( 1 )          V2&equals;(V2V1)A(2) From this relation, the following equation is obtained.             V 1   I 1   =   R 2  &af;  (  A - 1  )       ( 3 )           Thus, it can be understood that a negative resistor is connected to the terminal 1-2. Nextly, a transfer function from the driving circuit DRV to the output terminal 3-4 is as follows.             V 3   V 0   =   AR 2     {  1 +  (  1 / A  )   }  &it;  (   R  0 + 1   +  R 2   )   -  R  0 + 1         ( 4 )           FIG. 3 shows simulation results of frequency selectivity characteristic A when C&equals;20PF, L&equals;5 &mgr;H, R0&plus;R1&equals;20 &OHgr;, R2&equals;90 &OHgr;, R3&equals;R4&equals;390 &OHgr; in the circuit of FIG. 1 and a frequency selectivity characteristic B of an usual circuit without a negative resistance circuit for comparison. FIG. 4 shows simulation results of frequency selectivity characteristic when only C is changed from 5 pF to 12 pF or 50 pF. This figure teaches that in the tuning circuit of the present invention, a pass band width, that is, a frequency selectivity characteristic is constant and a tuning circuit gain is kept constant even if a capacity of the capacitor C is changed to change a tuning frequency. As explained above in detail, according to the present invention, Q can be increased and a tuning frequency can be changed while a path band width, that is, a frequency selectivity characteristic is constant even if a capacitor C is changed to change a tuning frequency and then a tuning circuit gain is constant.
